# Qualcomm Iris VA-API Test Results

Primary latest documented target: Fedora 44 ARM64 Snapdragon SM8550 tablet,
kernel `7.2.0-sm8550`. Device numbers are historical and must be resolved
through `iris_resolve_device`; target labels below distinguish separate boots
and replacement endpoints without exposing private network addresses.

## Passed

- The driver builds with the tablet's Meson/Ninja toolchain.
- `vainfo` loads the test driver from the project build directory.
- H.264 Main, High and Constrained Baseline profiles enumerate through VA-API.
- Chrome on the real GNOME Wayland session enters `VaapiVideoDecoder` and
  exports the full 25-surface VA pool without `invalid VASurfaceID` errors.
- Official Chrome 151 plays the 30-second H.264 test stream continuously in a
  clean single-browser session with the bounded 100 ms stateful sync wait. A
  25-second sample stayed at `readyState=4`, `paused=false`, and reported zero
  dropped frames while crossing one 30-second loop boundary.
- In a non-looping 30-second run, the hardware page reached
  `currentTime=30`, `ended=true`, `paused=true`, `readyState=4`, with all 720
  video frames accounted for and zero dropped frames.
- A clean-process event probe recorded the final `timeupdate` at 29.789s,
  followed directly by the normal `pause(ended=true)` and `ended` events at
  30s. Reloading an already-ended page can make Chrome seek to a restored
  position (for example 26.464s); that pause/seek/play sequence is browser
  media-session restoration, not a decoder stall.
- The default one-AU batches preserve exact timestamp association and completed
  a 30-second run without queue errors. `V4L2_VA_BATCH_SIZE=2..8` remains
  available for explicit throughput experiments; `1` is the production value.
- The stateful Iris path associates OUTPUT and CAPTURE buffers by timestamp and
  repeats SPS/PPS for every H.264 access unit. CAPTURE timestamps with no live
  OUTPUT entry are deliberately dropped; nearest-timestamp fallback was
  removed because a timed-out frame can otherwise be bound to a future surface
  and cause persistent frame corruption.
- Chrome 151 dual-video playback on the SM8550 tablet uses the stable
  per-surface DMA-BUF path and remained free of the exact `[0,136,0]` green
  frame in repeated 10-30 second canvas samples; both videos stayed on
  `VaapiVideoDecoder`.
- The test page defaults to a single pass. A `?loop=1` stress sample showed
  only the expected `30.0 -> 0.0` browser seek transition, with no anomalous
  green pixels. A software Chrome run selected `FFmpegVideoDecoder`, while
  the hardware run selected `VaapiVideoDecoder` for the same file.
- `chrome://gpu` reports `Video Decode: Hardware accelerated` with the rebuilt
  driver. The two-session context isolation probe passes with distinct V4L2
  session file descriptors.
- After the August 30, 2026 system installation, Google Chrome 151.0.7922.173
  was launched through `/usr/local/bin/iris-vaapi-browser` with no
  `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH` override. A 1920x1080 H.264 run reached
  `kVideoDecoderName=VaapiVideoDecoder` and
  `kIsPlatformVideoDecoder=true` in `chrome://media-internals`; the 30-second
  file completed with `readyState=4`, `ended=true`, 0 dropped frames, and 30
  seconds of media duration. The same environment intentionally selected
  `FFmpegVideoDecoder`/`kIsPlatformVideoDecoder=false` for a 320x180 sample,
  confirming Chromium's size/performance threshold rather than an installation
  failure.
- The stateful VP9 path decodes 20 frames from the Iris VP9 sample through
  FFmpeg VA-API with no hardware decode errors.
- The repeatable 320x180/24fps Iris matrix now validates decoded content, not
  only queue completion: H.264 and VP9 each decoded 48/48 frames and their
  per-frame `framemd5` output matched the software reference exactly. The
  capture readback path accounts for Iris' padded stride/height, and context
  teardown is serialized with concurrent VA surface downloads.
- The same matrix's native AV1 baseline (`matroskademux ! av1parse !
  v4l2av1dec`) reached GStreamer EOS successfully on `/dev/video17`.
- The matrix records MPEG-2 and VP8 as `SKIP` on this node because Iris does
  not enumerate their OUTPUT formats; this is a hardware capability result,
  not a driver failure.
- The EOS regression trace passes `test/iris-eos-check.sh`: all 720 H.264
  access units produce 720 OUTPUT DQBUF and 720 CAPTURE DQBUF completions,
  followed by one CAPTURE `LAST` marker after `decoder STOP`; CAPTURE sequence
  numbers are contiguous and no capture errors, timeout, or timestamp-miss
  records remain in the strict Chrome run. The pre-drain trace is rejected by
  the same check. Burst-style FFmpeg runs use the explicit
  `--allow-bounded-sync` mode, which still enforces all EOS/queue invariants
  while reporting bounded-wait diagnostics.
- The strict Qualcomm Iris matrix now passes H.264, VP9 and opt-in HEVC on
  five repeated cold starts: each codec produced 48/48 frames whose
  per-frame MD5 matches the software baseline, with 48 OUTPUT, 49 CAPTURE,
  one terminal LAST, no capture errors, and no timeout/timestamp diagnostics.
- A forced `V4L2_VA_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS=100` HEVC run exercised the trailing
  reorder recovery (one STOP/START pair) and still passed the same 48-frame
  MD5 and strict EOS oracle.
- The browser tail-frame regression was reproduced with a 60 Hz Canvas probe:
  before the follow-up fix, hardware sampling produced hashes that did not
  belong to any complete `requestVideoFrameCallback` frame and occasionally
  skipped `presentedFrames`; software did not. The queue-service path now stages
  CAPTURE data in a per-surface CPU snapshot and `syncSurface()` publishes it
  only while the target is still `Rendering`. Two rebuilt hardware single-pass
  runs and one loop-boundary run had contiguous frame numbers, no foreign pixel
  hashes, and a stable final frame. `test/iris-source-invariants.sh` rejects
  the old direct-copy path (red on the previous source, green on the fix).

## Pending

- Long-running arbitrary sites such as Douyin still need a user-session check;
  network-selected codecs and MSE seek patterns can exercise different paths.
- A new VA context can fail its initial export while another Iris session is
  holding the firmware queue; Chrome then reports `VaapiVideoDecoder` followed
  by an intentional `FFmpegVideoDecoder` fallback. Keep one hardware session
  per decoder node during diagnostics and treat this resource-contention case
  separately from decoded-pixel correctness.
- The stable DMA-BUF path adds one NV12 memcpy per decoded frame. The opt-in
  zero-copy experiment now removes that copy only for the validated one-AU,
  no-B H.264/VP9 contract; multi-slot ownership, B-frame reorder and broad
  dynamic-resolution coverage remain open.
- HEVC is advertised automatically when the node exposes stateful HEVC. The VA
  long format does not carry the original VPS/SPS/PPS, so the driver generates
  parameter sets from VA metadata; this path passes the strict 48-frame
  content/EOS matrix and repeated cold-start runs on both SM8550 tablets.
- AV1 is advertised automatically when the node exposes stateful AV1. The
  translator rebuilds complete temporal units from the VA tile payloads, so
  the OBU requirement recorded here earlier is met by the driver and not by
  the caller. `src/util/options.cc` no longer reads a switch for either codec;
  the qualified AV1 record is the 2026-10-22 section below.

## Deployment note

The latest target deployment rebuilt commit `400a46aed159f8a951bcb0a3d5dc6dd797a960bb`
and installed its driver, launcher and four desktop entries on August 30, 2026.
The system driver is `/usr/lib64/dri/v4l2_drv_video.so` with SHA-256
`f879e5ea417c770ac7042d520625e9cadcec1ffd00b43ca6658cfb811d5763ef`; the
install manifest is `/usr/local/share/iris-vaapi/install-manifest.txt` and
records the previous-driver backup. A system-path `vainfo` smoke test resolved
`/dev/video17` and enumerated H.264 and HEVC VA profiles. Browser playback and
Electron decoder claims still require their separate runtime gates.

## Secondary target

The second SM8550 tablet exposes the Iris decoder as `/dev/video0` (its
`/dev/video17` is a camera node). The full matrix was repeated three times on
`/dev/video0`, with the context-isolation probe before the first run:

- H.264, VP9 and opt-in HEVC each produced 48/48 frames whose per-frame MD5
  matched the software reference exactly.
- Each VA run passed strict EOS: 48 OUTPUT DQBUF, 49 CAPTURE DQBUF, one
  terminal `LAST`, contiguous capture sequence numbers, and zero timeout or
  timestamp-miss diagnostics.
- Native `v4l2h264dec`, `v4l2vp9dec`, `v4l2h265dec` and `v4l2av1dec` all reached
  GStreamer EOS. AV1 remains VA-skipped because the VA caller supplies tile
  payloads rather than the complete OBU temporal unit required by Iris.
- The two-context isolation probe passed with distinct V4L2 session file
  descriptors.

The browser-ending regression was reproduced with Chrome 151 on Wayland using
the secondary-target decoder. Before the fix, Chrome's context reset destroyed 14
stateful `Rendering` surfaces and each synchronous `destroySurfaces()` call
waited for the bounded timeout, producing 14 `Timed out waiting for surface`
records. The driver now removes the stateful batch mapping immediately when
the caller destroys such a target; late CAPTURE buffers are requeued by the
normal queue service. The old trace fails the regression checker with
`teardown_timeouts=14`; the rebuilt driver passes:

```
PASS teardown_timeouts=0 timestamp_misses=0 stateful_surface_teardown_skip=14
```

A clean 10-second single-pass browser probe then reached `ended=true`,
`readyState=4`, 301 presented frames, zero dropped frames, and identical canvas
pixel samples after `ended`. The final frame remained stable for repeated
samples, with no additional decode submissions after EOS.

## Follow-up structure tests (secondary target)

The browser probe was repeated with full RGBA SHA-256 snapshots at 28.5-30.0s.
The final canvas remained stable. The earlier 32-bit canvas hash result that
looked like a repeated old frame was a hash collision; it is not used as
evidence anymore.

Short, generated H.264 samples were then compared against FFmpeg software
`framemd5` output through the VA-API path:

| Sample | Structure | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ip-g12-1s.mp4` | 24 frames, no B, GOP 12 | 24/24 MD5 match |
| `ip-g48-2s.mp4` | 48 frames, no B, GOP 48 | 48/48 MD5 match |
| `intra-2s.mp4` | 48 all-I frames | 48/48 MD5 match |
| `b8-g120-2s.mp4` | 48 frames, B-frame stream | 48/48 MD5 match |
| `b4-g48-2s.mp4` | 48 frames, B-frame stream | 48/48 MD5 match after a 90s allowance |

The B=4 sample was previously reported as 12-14 frames only because the
15-25s harness timeout expired while the VA caller was synchronously waiting
for the reorder queue. A longer run completed normally and matched software;
that short-timeout result must not be called a decode corruption.

Two GOP-middle `-c copy` clips are different tests. `copy-mid-nots.mp4` starts
with P pictures before the next IDR and has an incomplete reference chain. It
produced 145/145 frames but one timestamp miss and one pixel mismatch. This is
consistent with the Linux stateful decoder contract: a client must seek to a
random-access point with the required SPS/PPS/reference state, and output from
an arbitrary P-frame cut is not a valid picture oracle. By contrast, Chromium's
official `mid-file-start-time.mp4` has a valid stream with a non-zero start PTS
and passed 250/250 VA frames with an exact software MD5 match; non-zero PTS by
itself is not the trigger.

These results narrow the remaining browser report to EOS/compositor timing or
an input-specific random-access pattern. They do not justify another driver
patch yet. Keep the long-GOP middle-cut sample as a negative/contract test, but
use complete files or keyframe-aligned clips for decoded-pixel pass criteria.

The reusable `test/iris-structure-matrix.sh` was run on the same `/dev/video0`
with 640x360/48-frame inputs. Its all-I, IP-only, B=2 and B=4 cases all passed
48/48 frames with exact software MD5, zero timestamp misses and zero bounded
sync timeouts.

## Latest follow-up (2026-08-30, `test/iris-stateful-followup`)

Target: Fedora ARM64 Snapdragon SM8550 tablet, Iris decoder resolved at runtime;
driver built in an external lab workspace.

- Stateful EOS drain is opt-in with `V4L2_VA_STATEFUL_EOS_DRAIN=1` (the legacy
  `V4L2_VA_EOS_DRAIN=1` alias remains supported). The default idle threshold is
  400ms, based on the measured 325ms maximum normal batch gap and the 458ms
  stale-tail onset. A 30s H.264 browser run reached `ended=true` with 72/72
  tail frames and zero repeated hashes; the trace had one STOP/LAST/START,
  zero timeouts and zero timestamp misses.
- The drain implementation now waits for trailing OUTPUT DQBUF after the
  terminal CAPTURE LAST marker before issuing START, as required by the Linux
  stateful V4L2 contract. The post-change `matrix-general-followup` repeated
  the H.264, VP9 and HEVC checks with no regressions.
- A 115s `loop=true` Chrome probe crossed three 30s loop seeks with 2741 frame
  callbacks, zero gaps over 200ms, zero dropped frames and no trace timeout or
  timestamp miss.
- The standard 48-frame VA matrix passed H.264, VP9 and HEVC with exact software
  framemd5 equality. Each had 48 OUTPUT, 49 CAPTURE, one terminal LAST, and no
  capture errors, timeouts or timestamp misses. Native AV1 reached GStreamer
  EOS; VA AV1 remains skipped because the VA tile payload lacks Iris' required
  complete OBU temporal unit.
- The H.264 structure matrix (all-I, IP/GOP12, B=2, B=4) passed 48/48 with exact
  software MD5. HEVC with `V4L2_VA_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS=100` also passed 48/48 and
  strict EOS with one recovery STOP/START pair.
- The EOS watchdog remains opt-in because VA-API has no portable end-of-input
  callback. Its startup guard now requires eight submitted AUs and one
  completed frame, so normal HEVC startup gaps are not treated as EOS.
- The generic watchdog now requires eight submitted AUs and one completed
  frame, and both timeout recovery and idle drain refuse to issue START until
  CAPTURE `V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST` is observed. Default and watchdog-enabled
  H.264/VP9/HEVC matrices on `/dev/video0` passed 48/48 with exact software
  MD5; the forced 100ms timeout HEVC matrix also passed strict EOS and content
  checks. MPEG-2/VP8 remain correctly reported as unavailable on this node,
  while native AV1 reaches EOS and VA AV1 remains skipped for its tile/OBU
  payload contract.

The state-machine changes follow the Linux stateful decoder contract and the
queue handling used by reference clients:

- Linux V4L2 stateful decoder drain: <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.4/userspace-api/media/v4l/dev-decoder.html>
- Chromium stateful V4L2 client: <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/a576d2ae67f9a89b4ac118460c7e4e4763f8c22a/media/gpu/v4l2/v4l2_stateful_video_decoder.cc>
- GStreamer V4L2 decoder: <https://github.com/GStreamer/gst-plugins-good/blob/master/sys/v4l2/gstv4l2videodec.c>

This follow-up is recorded on branch `test/iris-stateful-followup` in commits
`95de0d4` (state-machine safety), `e753088` (watchdog/source guards),
`0288082` and `c2f1211` (generic client documentation), and `cafa6b9`
(generic trace-checker arguments).

## Dedicated hardware suite (2026-08-30, `/dev/video0`)

The complete hardware plan from the earlier investigation was run on
the Fedora 44 ARM64 SM8550 tablet. The repeatable entry
point is `test/iris-hardware-suite.sh`; its logs and generated media are kept
under a local scratch directory and are not repository inputs.

Qualcomm's upstream `v4l-video-test-app` (`b1f1a04`) was built natively with
shared Fedora FFmpeg/JsonCpp libraries (the upstream CMake file requests static
libraries that are not shipped by Fedora). Its JSON decoder client passed all
four advertised codecs:

- H.264: 32/32 decoded frames, 44,236,800-byte NV12 dump;
- VP9, HEVC and AV1: 48/48 frames each, 4,147,200-byte NV12 dumps.

Every dump matched an FFmpeg software `nv12` decode byte-for-byte. A second
Qualcomm run with two concurrent H.264 contexts passed both clients and both
outputs matched the software reference. A mixed four-context run (H.264,
VP9, HEVC, AV1) also returned four `SUCCESS` results and all four dumps matched
their software references.

The V4L2 contract checks reported 47/48 tests succeeded. The sole reported
failure is the `v4l2-compliance` stateful decoder control-class check, while
the same device exposes `min_number_of_capture_buffers` (`0x00980927`) through
`v4l2-ctl`; the verbose report and raw control inventory are retained for
follow-up with v4l-utils. No ioctl, format, queue, buffer or decoder-command
failure was reported.

Native GStreamer pipelines (`v4l2h264dec`, `v4l2vp9dec`, `v4l2h265dec`,
`v4l2av1dec`) all reached EOS. GstValidate reached EOS as well, but on this
GStreamer 1.28 build it reports a `gst_structure_remove_field: IS_MUTABLE`
critical for VP9/HEVC/AV1 and an EOS-seqnum diagnostic for H.264; the plain
`gst-launch-1.0` pipelines are clean, so these are recorded as GStreamer
validator diagnostics rather than Iris pixel failures.

Fluster corpus results were completed with the GStreamer V4L2 decoders. The
JSON reports are retained in the tablet scratch directory
`$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/iris-hw-suite-20260830`:

| Suite / decoder | Total | Passed | Error/Fail/Timeout | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| JVT-AVC_V1 / H.264 | 135 | 40 | 95 errors | Main-profile vectors pass; failures are concentrated in field/MBAFF/PAFF, extended and other conformance profiles rejected by this node. |
| JVT-FR-EXT / H.264 | 69 | 0 | 69 errors | Fidelity Range Extension/extended interlaced capability is not exposed by the firmware. |
| JCT-VC-HEVC_V1 / HEVC | 147 | 112 | 34 errors, 1 fail | Main/Main10 and ordinary coding vectors pass where advertised; advanced WPP/tiles/10-bit vectors are rejected. |
| VP9-TEST-VECTORS / VP9 | 305 | 235 | 68 errors, 1 fail, 1 timeout | Failures are 8x8 through 66x66 extreme dimensions, 4:2:2/4:4:4, dynamic resize and SVC cases. The timeout is the 16x16 all-intra stress vector. |
| VP9-TEST-VECTORS-HIGH / VP9 | 6 | 0 | 6 errors | 10/12-bit 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4 is outside the advertised 8-bit 4:2:0 capability. |
| AV1-TEST-VECTORS / AV1 | 242 | 200 | 42 errors | Non-passes are limited to tiny dimensions, monochrome, dynamic resize and SVC-layer vectors. |
| CHROMIUM-8bit-AV1-TEST-VECTORS / AV1 | 13 | 13 | 0 | Chromium's 8-bit AV1 coverage passes in full. |

Two corpus downloads reported checksum mismatches (`brcm_freh5` in
`JVT-FR-EXT` and `SLPPLP_A_VIDYO_2` in `JCT-VC-HEVC_V1`). Fluster keeps those
metadata entries as errors; they are not treated as decoded hardware failures.

The one HEVC checksum failure, `RAP_A_docomo_6`, was rerun three times. The
software reference emits 86 416x240 I420 frames (`8a536a80...`); Iris emits a
stable 85-frame sequence (`c074ee17...`) beginning at the software second
frame. The three hardware byte streams were identical. This is a deterministic
RAP/RASL output capability difference in the native stateful path, not a
non-repeatable pixel corruption; it is kept as a negative capability result
until a client/firmware contract for leading RASL pictures is established.

The VP9 timeout is likewise an isolated 16x16 all-intra stress case. The
remaining 235 vectors complete in 64.5 seconds, and no timeout appears in the
standard VA matrix or Qualcomm mixed-codec client. These external corpus
results therefore do not justify another production-driver change.

This run adds the generic orchestration script and documents the distinction
between codec correctness, V4L2 contract checks, and firmware capability
boundaries. It does not change the production driver based on external-tool
diagnostics.

## Follow-up investigation (2026-08-30, branch `codex/claude-followup`, secondary target)

The follow-up route was continued on a durable secondary lab. Local
`bash test/run-static-checks.sh` and `ninja -C build-local` passed. The remote
deployment performed the content sync, clean rebuild and `ldd -r` gate with no
undefined symbols; the resulting driver SHA-256 was
`f8a8e684f6ddb072bc19b31f9bc3c33e3145b2bcc85ecede45ff560919a64ee3`.

The positive 48-frame VA matrix was then repeated from the deployed checkout:
H.264, VP9 and HEVC each produced 48/48 frames with exact software framemd5,
strict EOS (`48 OUTPUT`, `49 CAPTURE`, one terminal `LAST`) and zero timeout or
timestamp-miss diagnostics. Native H.264/VP9/HEVC/AV1 GStreamer baselines all
reached EOS; AV1 VA remains intentionally disabled by its tile-payload versus
OBU contract.

After commit `6074609` reset the barren cold-start budget on every STOP/START,
the driver was deployed again (`68cc99da41d81f162944fec487d9371f15b1beefa7c05020a70a96af936cdb83`)
and the same H.264/VP9/HEVC 48-frame matrix passed unchanged. With
`LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH` unset, `vainfo` also auto-discovered `/dev/video0` by
the `iris_driver` name and enumerated the expected H.264, HEVC and VP9
profiles.

The driver-path Fluster probes used `FFmpeg-*-VAAPI`, unlike the firmware-only
`GStreamer-*-V4L2` table above. Results were deliberately kept as diagnostics:

| Probe | Result |
| --- | --- |
| H.264 `BA1_FT_C`, `BA1_Sony_D` | `1/2` passed; `BA1_Sony_D` remains a reproducible content mismatch. |
| HEVC `DBLK_G_VIXS_2`, `RAP_B_Bossen_2`, `SAO_G_Canon_3` | `0/3` passed; all returned content mismatches. |
| VP9 two basic vectors plus one resize vector | `2/3` passed; resize returned an accelerator error. |
| AV1 Chromium 8-bit, three vectors, opt-in translator | `0/3` passed; the experimental VA path returned decoder errors. |

The stock Fluster FFmpeg wrapper uses `-hwaccel vaapi` followed by a software
format filter and does not request an explicit VAAPI output pool. It is useful
for exposing timeout and surface-lifetime boundaries, but `iris-matrix.sh` is
the authoritative VA pixel oracle. A full 135-vector H.264 driver-path run was
started with a 5-second per-vector bound and safely stopped after repeated
cases still took roughly 30 seconds to terminate; its partial output is not
claimed as a suite result.

Two bounded stress checks explain the remaining H.264 signal. For
`BA1_Sony_D`, one-, two- and three-frame keyframe-aligned streams were
bit-exact, while the complete 17-frame stream produced 17 frames with
non-deterministic duplicate/out-of-order hashes. Increasing FFmpeg's surface
pool and toggling `V4L2_VA_COPY_SURFACES` did not remove it. `AUD_MW_E` returned
100 frames in 9 seconds with 63 bounded sync timeouts and 10 startup
backpressure records, but its frame hashes still differed from software. These
are open surface/firmware interaction diagnostics, not grounds for another
unverified production patch.

## Dynamic-resolution follow-up (2026-08-30, branch `codex/claude-followup`, primary target)

The next investigation item was completed against the current Iris node
`/dev/video4` on the SM8550 tablet. `VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` reports the NV12
capture range `96x96 - 8192x8192`; the VA runtime probe returned the same
`MinWidth=96`, `MaxWidth=8192`, `MinHeight=96`, and `MaxHeight=8192` values.
The old hard-coded `32/2048` surface attributes are gone. The range is scoped
to the profile's eligible decoder devices and uses their common intersection.

The deployed driver passed the 48-frame VA matrix for H.264, VP9, and HEVC:
each codec matched the software framemd5 exactly, with strict EOS accounting
(`48 OUTPUT`, `49 CAPTURE`, one `LAST`, zero timeout or timestamp-miss
diagnostics). The two-context isolation probe also passed.

The Fluster VP9 dynamic vector
`vp90-2-14-resize-fp-tiles-1-8.webm` completed all 18 frames through VA. The
driver and native `v4l2vp9dec` outputs were byte-identical for every 432x240 and
3840x2160 segment. One 3840x2160 segment from both hardware paths differs from
the software decoder at the same byte offset, so that isolated difference is
recorded as deterministic firmware behavior rather than a VA-driver mismatch.
The backend now also drains and rebuilds stateful V4L2 queues when a VA client
reuses one context for a surface with a new geometry.

## Zero-copy experiment (2026-08-30, branch `codex/claude-followup`, primary target)

The same route was extended with an opt-in `V4L2_VA_ZERO_COPY=1`
path. Stateful single-plane NV12 CAPTURE buffers can now import the per-surface
DMA-BUF directly; the V4L2 `Buffer` owns a duplicated fd and no longer maps a
kernel MMAP slot. Surface reuse requeues the imported buffer, while setup or
plane validation failures fall back to the existing MMAP plus stable-copy path.
The default remains unchanged and Chrome is not modified.

The Iris firmware assigns a decoded frame to any queued CAPTURE slot rather
than honoring a VA-surface index. The experiment therefore keeps one imported
slot in flight for H.264/VP9 and uses an extra scratch slot for STOP/LAST drain;
otherwise a frame can land in the wrong exported fd. HEVC/AV1 are rejected from
this experimental contract and automatically use the stable-copy path because
their reorder depth needs multiple simultaneously queued CAPTURE slots.

| Run | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Primary target, zero-copy H.264 matrix, 48 frames | `48/48`, exact software framemd5, `49 CAPTURE`, one `LAST`, zero timeout/timestamp misses. Trace confirms no `copy_surface_frame` for decoded CAPTURE. |
| Primary target, zero-copy VP9 matrix, 48 frames | `48/48`, exact software framemd5, strict EOS and zero timeout/timestamp misses. |
| Primary target, zero-copy HEVC matrix, 48 frames | Stable-copy fallback (`codec_reorder_contract`); `48/48` exact software framemd5 and strict EOS. |
| Primary target, zero-copy H.264 structure, 24 frames | all-I and IP/GOP12 pass; B=2/B=4 fail because the one-slot contract cannot satisfy Iris reorder depth. This is retained as a known opt-in limit, not a default-path regression. |
| Primary target, default MMAP structure, 24 frames | all-I, IP/GOP12, B=2 and B=4 all pass with exact software framemd5. |

The remote clean rebuild and `ldd -r` gate passed for every iteration. The
experiment removes the CAPTURE-to-stable-buffer memcpy only for the validated
no-B H.264/VP9 path; it is not yet a universal replacement for native
multi-slot zero-copy behavior.

After the first dynamic VP9 probe, the tablet powered off before the bounded
command returned and the SSH endpoint changed. A follow-up guard now detects a
dynamic-resolution request while DMA-BUF capture is active, releases the
experimental queue without a long drain, and rebuilds the context on MMAP plus
stable copy. This guard passed local static checks and remote compilation on
the earlier primary/secondary targets; hardware confirmation on a replacement
endpoint is still
pending because that address was not reachable during this run.

## Post-reset diagnosis and stable-path regression (2026-08-30, replacement target)

The replacement target was inspected read-only before any
decode run. The previous boot ended abruptly at `17:24:56` and the next boot
started at `17:25:41`; there is no `reboot.target`, `shutdown`, `OOM`, panic,
Oops, or watchdog record in the previous boot. The new boot also reported that
the old system and user journals were corrupted or uncleanly shut down. The
Qualcomm command line carried `bootinfo.pureason=0x80001` and
`bootinfo.pdreason=0x2`: the public Xiaomi bootinfo layout maps this to the
`HWRST` power-up bit plus the `OTHER` reset-reason bit, not a normal software
reboot, kernel panic, or watchdog code. `/sys/fs/pstore` was empty and no
`/proc/last_kmsg` was available, so the lower-level trigger remains unknown.

Immediately before the reset, `uperf-linux` recorded heavy load and a maximum
temperature of `92.7 C`, then returned to `51 C`; this makes a thermal/power
transient plausible but does not prove it. After reboot the battery reported
88% and `Discharging`, so an empty battery is not supported by the snapshot.

The remote `.so` left by the interrupted run was zero-filled (`invalid ELF
header`), which explains why the first post-reset VA probe stopped before
decoding. A single-thread clean rebuild produced a valid AArch64 shared object
and passed `ldd -r` with no undefined symbols. With `V4L2_VA_ZERO_COPY` and all
optional drain/trace switches explicitly unset, the stable MMAP/copy path then
passed:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| H.264 VA, 12 frames | 12/12 exact framemd5; 12 OUTPUT, 13 CAPTURE, one LAST; zero timeout/miss |
| VP9 VA, 12 frames | 12/12 exact framemd5; 12 OUTPUT, 13 CAPTURE, one LAST; zero timeout/miss |
| HEVC VA, 12 frames | 12/12 exact framemd5; 12 OUTPUT, 13 CAPTURE, one LAST; zero timeout/miss |
| Native AV1 V4L2 | GStreamer EOS |
| VA context isolation | two contexts created successfully |
| `v4l2-compliance` | 47/48; only the known stateful `V4L2_CID_MIN_BUFFERS_FOR_CAPTURE` control classification failed |

The device remained on the same boot throughout this regression. The opt-in
DMA-BUF zero-copy path was not run after the reset diagnosis.

## Zero-copy follow-up (2026-08-30, replacement target)

After the clean rebuild, the opt-in DMA-BUF path was exercised on the same
device with the default EOS and watchdog switches unset. Static no-B H.264 and
VP9 both passed 12-frame and 48-frame runs with exact software framemd5. The
48-frame traces each contain 48 OUTPUT, 49 CAPTURE (including one terminal
`LAST`), zero timeout/timestamp diagnostics, and zero `copy_surface_frame`
records; the trace shows the expected DMA-BUF import and single-slot CAPTURE
queue. HEVC with the switch enabled passed 12/12 as well, but correctly logged
`codec_reorder_contract` and used the stable copy path (`copy_surface_frame`
records present).

Dynamic-resolution probes were kept separate from the positive static oracle:

- `320x180 <-> 160x90` was rejected at the second geometry because `160x90`
  is below the node's declared minimum height of 96; only 10/30 frames were
  valid, so this is a capability-boundary result.
- The `432x240 <-> 848x480` VP9 sample produced the same CAPTURE errors and
  sequence failures with both zero-copy and MMAP VA paths. It is not evidence
  of a zero-copy-only regression and remains outside the positive oracle.
- A smaller `352x288 <-> 282x173` resize sample likewise failed in the MMAP
  VA path after its context handoff, with native V4L2 still reaching EOS.

These FFmpeg resize flows create a new VA context for each geometry, so the
context-local `dynamic_resolution` zero-copy fallback is not reached before
the firmware/input failure. Keep zero-copy disabled for dynamic-resolution
clients until a caller that reuses one VA context across the change is tested.
No Chrome or driver source change was made in this follow-up.

## Zero-copy batch-contract guard (2026-08-30, replacement target)

An opt-in probe with `V4L2_VA_ZERO_COPY=1` and `V4L2_VA_BATCH_SIZE=8` showed
that Iris can hold the aggregated OUTPUT until STOP when only one imported
CAPTURE slot is queued; the first `vaSyncSurface()` then failed with an empty
framemd5 output. This is the expected limit of the current one-slot ownership
model, not a default-path regression. The backend now requires the explicit
one-AU batch contract for DMA-BUF capture and logs
`stateful zero-copy fallback reason=batch_contract`, leaving the stable
MMAP/copy path active for larger throughput batches.

Repeating the same `BATCH_SIZE=8` command after the guard logged the expected
fallback, but the stable-copy batch run still failed before its first frame on
this Iris firmware/input combination. Larger batching therefore remains an
unsupported throughput experiment here; the guard's purpose is to prevent it
from being mistaken for a working zero-copy mode.

After deploying the guard, the explicit one-AU run (`V4L2_VA_ZERO_COPY=1`,
`V4L2_VA_BATCH_SIZE=1`) passed the complete 48-frame matrix on the replacement
target:
H.264, VP9, and HEVC each produced exact software framemd5 with strict
`49 CAPTURE / 48 OUTPUT / 1 LAST` accounting and zero timeout/timestamp-miss
diagnostics. H.264 and VP9 had zero `copy_surface_frame` records; HEVC had 48
stable-copy records plus the expected `codec_reorder_contract` fallback.

## Battery power comparison (2026-08-30, replacement target)

This section measures paced GStreamer/FFmpeg pipelines into fakesink, not a
browser, and ends by requiring an actual Chrome playback run before any
battery-life claim. That run is now recorded below under
[Browser battery comparison](#browser-battery-comparison-2026-09-02-chrome-151).

The comparison used the battery gauge exposed at
`/sys/class/power_supply/qcom-battmgr-bat`: `voltage_now` multiplied by the
absolute value of `current_now`, sampled once per second. Each run used the
same 1280x720 or 1920x1080, 30 fps, 60-second H.264 file with no B frames and
ran a 30-second real-time decode. The native path was GStreamer
`v4l2h264dec` with `capture-io-mode=4` (DMABUF capture). The VA paths used the
deployed driver with either stable copy (`V4L2_VA_ZERO_COPY=0`) or the
one-AU DMA-BUF experiment (`V4L2_VA_ZERO_COPY=1`); software used FFmpeg's
ordinary CPU decoder. Every run collected 10 seconds of pre- and post-run
baseline, 30 seconds of decode samples, temperature, load, and capacity.

The primary value below is the battery-side decode increment: run power minus
the midpoint of the pre/post baselines. It is not decoder-package power; the
screen and the rest of the tablet remain included. Values are mean +/- a
two-sided 95% t interval over independent runs.

Important interpretation: this is a paced `-re`/fakesink baseline, not a
browser playback result. It measures the work needed to sustain 30 fps while
allowing the decoder and compositor to sleep between frames, so it can hide
the cost of a busy software pipeline. Do not use the small real-time delta or
the runtime table below as a claim that software video playback costs only a
few tens of milliwatts.

| Workload | Native DMABUF | VA stable copy | VA zero-copy | Software |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1280x720, n=5 | +42 +/- 16 mW | +50 +/- 21 mW | +64 +/- 41 mW | +92 +/- 55 mW |
| 1920x1080, filtered n=4/3/4/3 | +68 +/- 21 mW | +100 +/- 5 mW | +50 +/- 27 mW | +187 +/- 133 mW |

Absolute battery power during the 720p runs was 2.554 W (native), 2.554 W
(VA copy), 2.559 W (VA zero-copy), and 2.615 W (software). The 1080p filtered
means were 2.595 W, 2.601 W, 2.556 W, and 2.699 W respectively. Temperature
stayed between 30.5 and 31.0 C; capacity moved from 83% to 79% over the whole
experiment. All 20 runs at 720p and all 16 runs at 1080p returned zero;
the native and zero-copy traces were separately checked for the expected
capture mode and no VA decode errors.

Two 1080p samples were excluded before aggregation because their pre/post
baseline gap was about 7.4 W, a power-management transition unrelated to the
decoder. The raw CSV files and logs remain in
`$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/artifacts/power-compare-20260830/` on the tablet (and
the copied analysis inputs are under a scratch directory).

This measurement does not demonstrate a statistically significant battery
advantage for the experimental zero-copy path over the native or VA-copy
paths at 720p; the memcpy removed by zero-copy is small compared with gauge
noise and whole-device background power. At 1080p the zero-copy result trends
lower than VA copy, but the filtered sample is still too small for a firm
claim. Software is consistently the highest path, while all hardware paths
remain in the same roughly 2.55-2.60 W whole-device band.

### CPU and unrestricted-load cross-check

FFmpeg's verbose stream mapping for the software command was
`h264 (native) -> wrapped_avframe (native)`, with no hardware input options.
During an additional real-time 720p run, the decoder process consumed about
1.7% of one CPU core for native V4L2, 4.4% for VA stable copy, 3.3% for VA
zero-copy, and 21.1% for the software decoder. This confirms that the small
real-time battery delta is not a software-decoder bypass.

To expose the cost hidden by real-time pacing, each path was also run in a
20-second unrestricted loop at 720p. Absolute battery power during that load
was 2.98 W (native V4L2), 3.04 W (VA zero-copy), and 7.23 W (software). The
loop was deliberately stopped by the harness (the FFmpeg paths returned their
expected signal-stop code), so these figures are a stress direction check,
not a playback estimate. They show that CPU software decoding can add several
watts when the content, frame rate, or browser pipeline keeps the decoder busy.

An independent software-only recheck on the same tablet used the same input
and sampling method. It measured 6.764 W during the 20-second unrestricted
decode, with 3.251 W and 3.639 W pre/post baselines; against their 3.445 W
midpoint, the software decode increment was about +3.32 W. The different
absolute baseline shows why one short run cannot provide a fixed watt number,
but the multi-watt software increment reproduces the direction and order of
magnitude of the original stress result.

### Runtime translation

At the end of the run the tablet reported `charge_full=8884000` uAh,
`state_of_health=94`, and 78% capacity. Using a conservative 3.85 V average
battery voltage gives about 25.0 Wh from the observed 78% down to a 5% reserve,
or 32.5 Wh from 100% down to that reserve. Dividing those energies by the
measured whole-device decode power gives the following fakesink baseline:

| Mode | 78% -> 5% | 100% -> 5% |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Native DMABUF, 720p | 9.8 h | 12.7 h |
| VA copy, 720p | 9.8 h | 12.7 h |
| VA zero-copy, 720p | 9.8 h | 12.7 h |
| Software, 720p | 9.5 h | 12.4 h |

These are not browser numbers: they include the measured screen/background
load but not Chrome composition, page activity, or network traffic. They are a
controlled low-load baseline, not a promise that software playback only costs
50-100 mW. The unrestricted-load cross-check demonstrates that a busy software
decoder can consume several additional watts. For a real browser estimate,
the decisive variables are codec, resolution, frame complexity, refresh rate,
panel brightness, and Wi-Fi; an actual Chrome playback run is required before
turning this table into a battery-life guarantee.

## Browser battery comparison (2026-09-02, Chrome 151)

The run the section above asks for. Google Chrome 151.0.7922.173 played one
1920x1080, 30 fps, High profile, level 4.0 H.264 file with no B frames, looped
from `file://` in kiosk mode on the tablet's own panel, with hardware VA-API
decode measured against Chrome's software decoder.

`test/iris-power-compare.sh` produced the collection and
`test/remote/power-analyze.py` aggregated it (both were removed from the tree
in the Phase 6 trim, commit `41ef499`; the numbers below stand as recorded
and cannot be reproduced from the current tree). Five interleaved ABBA blocks, ten
runs; each run is a 300-second measurement window after 20 seconds of warmup,
bracketed by 60-second idle baselines with a 30-second gap between runs. The
arms differ by one switch: the software arm adds
`--disable-accelerated-video-decode`. Everything else, including the launcher,
the LIBVA environment, the profile layout and the page, is identical.

### What the runs show

| Arm | Playback | Baseline | Increment | CPU | Decoder |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Hardware, n=5 | 2.745 +/- 0.040 W | 2.458 W | +0.287 +/- 0.058 W | 0.205 cores | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, `kIsPlatformVideoDecoder=true` |
| Software, n=5 | 2.844 +/- 0.013 W | 2.443 W | +0.401 +/- 0.039 W | 0.490 cores | `FFmpegVideoDecoder`, `kIsPlatformVideoDecoder=false` |

The statistic is the per-block paired difference, not two pooled means:

```text
software - hardware, playback power:  +0.0988 +/- 0.0448 W   (n=5 blocks)
software - hardware, increment:       +0.1145 +/- 0.0861 W
```

Both intervals are two-sided 95% t intervals and both exclude zero. Hardware
decode costs about 99 mW less whole-device power, roughly 3.5% of the 2.8 W the
tablet draws while playing, and it halves the browser's CPU.

All ten runs were valid and none was dropped. The two arms' idle baselines
landed 15 mW apart (2.458 W against 2.443 W), which is the control that makes
the 99 mW separation readable at all.

### Provenance per run

Playback alone proves nothing here, because both arms play the video. Each run
required the Media domain to name the decoder and the frame counters to advance
inside the window. Independently of Chrome's self-report, every hardware run
had exactly one process holding the resolved Iris node and it was the GPU
process; every software run had none.

Frame accounting was 8991-8997 decoded per 300-second window against a 9000
frame ideal, with one dropped frame across all ten runs. The backlight was
pinned at 1024/2047 and recorded per sample: every run reported a single level
for its whole duration. Thermals stayed between 36.9 C and 37.7 C mean, 39.4 C
peak. Capacity fell from 63% to 52% across the collection; no external supply
came online in any sample.

Driver `f879e5ea417c770a`, source commit `0ced73ee3f3b`, clean tree, kernel
`7.2.2-sm8550-gad75da3`, decoder node `/dev/video0`. The artifacts are under
`$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/artifacts/power-browser-20260902b/` on the tablet, with
`report.json` holding the full per-run record.

### Runtime translation

`charge_full` reads 8931000 uAh. At a conservative 3.85 V average that is about
34.4 Wh, or 32.7 Wh from full down to a 5% reserve.

| Mode | Playback time from 100% to 5% |
| --- | ---: |
| Hardware VA-API | 11.9 h |
| Software | 11.5 h |

About 25 extra minutes of 1080p30 playback per charge. That is the honest size
of this effect for this clip, at this brightness, with no network traffic and a
page that does nothing but hold a video element.

### What this does not say

The earlier fakesink section measured several watts of difference under an
unrestricted decode loop. Both results are real and they answer different
questions: a browser playing 30 fps is a paced workload that lets the CPU idle
between frames, so the software decoder never runs flat out. Content at a
higher resolution or frame rate, a heavier page, or a device with a dimmer
panel would all widen the gap; this run does not measure any of them.

The comparison is also whole-device. The panel at 1024/2047 accounts for most
of the 2.4 W baseline, which is why a 99 mW decode difference is 3.5% of the
total rather than 3.5% of the decoder.

Only H.264 was measured. HEVC is a qualified VA path but was not part of this
collection, and VA VP9 remains withdrawn on this target.

Only Google Chrome was measured, and that is not an arbitrary choice. Fedora's
Chromium 151.0.7922.169, launched through the same `iris-vaapi-browser` with
the same environment, reports `V4L2VideoDecoder` with
`kIsPlatformVideoDecoder=true` and its GPU process holds the Iris node
directly. It decodes in hardware through Chromium's own native V4L2 stack and
never loads this driver, so a Chromium arm would measure that stack rather than
this project. A Chromium hardware-versus-software comparison is still worth
running; it just answers a different question and needs its own section.

### First collection, discarded

An earlier collection the same night lost all ten runs. GNOME's `idle-dim` was
not among the locked settings, so the panel dimmed partway through the first
block, and `brightness_start` was captured once before the first block rather
than per run, which then reported every later run as broken against a value it
never had. The runs were internally consistent, with hardware increments in
0.349-0.403 W and software in 0.468-0.658 W, but by the harness's own rules
they were not comparable and they are not used here.

`idle-dim` is now locked, and the backlight is a sampled column rather than two
edge readings, so a panel that dims and recovers inside a run cannot pass.
`test/iris-power-report-check.sh` holds the analyser to that rule.

## Zero-copy/package follow-up (2026-09-03)

The package provenance issue found after the previous handoff is fixed. The
Fedora spec now runs the complete ELF post-processing chain before refreshing
the staged install manifest, and the Arch PKGBUILD disables a later implicit
strip, strips explicitly, and refreshes the same fields. A real Fedora
`rpmbuild` from the phase-4 source completed with all 17 repository tests
passing; extracting the resulting RPM showed that the manifest hash and size
matched the final stripped `/usr/lib64/dri/v4l2_drv_video.so`. The installed
tablet package was then replaced from that RPM and `rpm -V` passed.

The bounded zero-copy contract was exercised on the installed package under a
boot/temperature guard. The target was Fedora 44 ARM64 on SM8550, kernel
`7.2.2-sm8550-gad75da3`, boot ID
`ee2f8dbc-95e9-4dbb-81fc-6f288ba64c99`, with `/dev/video0` resolved by the
`iris_driver` name as `Iris Decoder` (the sibling `/dev/video1` is `Iris
The first installed artifact for this follow-up was source commit
`c7b251dcbb452d6dda9450f39cc2b8e94adbb5ee`. A final Fedora RPM was then
rebuilt from source commit `42190a4628f97a2dd10f259de35fe6bdda125b5e` and
installed in its place; its final stripped driver SHA-256 is
`3816b5714ce4053aa4398daf9e93802f17d97c2884a5743e6cbc437310267252` and its
size is `301632` bytes. The RPM payload manifest matches those bytes and
`rpm -V` passes.

The short qualification results were:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Default installed VA H.264/HEVC | 12/12 exact framemd5 each; strict `13 CAPTURE / 12 OUTPUT / 1 LAST`; zero timeout/miss |
| Direct zero-copy H.264 all-I and IP/GOP12 | 24/24 exact framemd5 each; zero `copy_surface_frame`; strict EOS |
| H.264 B=2 without ownership contract | 24/24 exact framemd5 through stable-copy fallback |
| HEVC with zero-copy requested | 24/24 exact framemd5 through `codec_reorder_contract` stable-copy fallback |
| Two concurrent zero-copy H.264 contexts | 30-second shortened soak; 720 frames per context, zero timeout/miss, strict EOS, boot unchanged |
| Qualcomm `v4l-video-test-app` | 90-frame H.264 NV12 output byte-identical to its reference |
| `v4l2-compliance` | 47/48; the one known stateful `Min Number of Capture Buffers` classification failure |
| Chrome surface acceptance | 1920x1080 real surface, frames advanced with zero drops in the zero-copy launch; decoder evidence was independently `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true |
| Chromium surface acceptance | `V4L2VideoDecoder`, platform=true, 151 frames, zero drops; native V4L2 path, not this VA driver |

The new power harness supports Chrome stable-copy, Chrome zero-copy, and
Chromium native-V4L2 collections. The phase-4 Chrome zero-copy pilot was
correctly rejected because an external charger came online during the window;
the short Chrome-copy pilot was rejected once for an unstable pre/post baseline.
Those samples are not results. The only statistically qualified browser power
claim remains the earlier five-block Chrome stable-copy comparison above; no
zero-copy-versus-copy or Chromium power claim is made until a complete
discharging ABBA collection is run.

Accordingly, zero-copy remains an explicit `h264-no-b-v1` experiment and is
not enabled by the default launcher or package. The current evidence does not
qualify a multi-slot, B-frame, HEVC, AV1, or dynamic-resolution zero-copy path.

## Zero-copy requalification (2026-09-08, current build)

Target: Fedora 44 ARM64 on SM8550, boot ID
`36da96d7-8a95-4abe-b041-949b7c9f8590` (unchanged through every run below),
Chrome `152.0.7977.82`, decoder resolved by the `iris_driver` name. All
firmware-risky runs went through `scripts/iris-experiment-guard.sh` (or the
soak's own boot/temperature guard); no reset, no thermal breach. The build
under test includes the stream-switch green-flash work (completed-frame
tracking with fail-closed error release; sync timeouts stay patient for
B-frame reorder, proven by the B=2 fallback case below).

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Zero-copy suite, H.264 all-I and IP/GOP12 direct | 24/24 exact framemd5 each; zero `copy_surface_frame`; strict EOS |
| Zero-copy suite, H.264 B=2 without contract | 24/24 exact framemd5 through stable-copy fallback |
| Zero-copy suite, HEVC with zero-copy requested | 24/24 exact framemd5 through `codec_reorder_contract` fallback |
| Dynamic resolution, default path, 100 switches | native 202/100 exact pixels; VA single-process 202/100 exact md5; 101 fresh contexts exact md5 |
| Chrome DRC stream under zero-copy env, ~1000 switches | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 2134 decoded / 2 dropped in 90 s; zero-copy engaged, zero `copy_surface_frame`, zero errors/timeouts, boot unchanged |
| Concurrent dual-H.264 soak, default path, SHORTENED 300 s | 7200 frames per context, zero timeout/miss, strict EOS |
| Concurrent dual-H.264 soak, zero-copy, SHORTENED 300 s | 7200 frames per context, zero timeout/miss, both traces show `zero-copy enabled` with zero copies |

Same-VA-context dynamic-resolution under zero-copy (the
`dynamic_resolution` fallback arm in `reconfigure_stateful_dimensions`)
remains runtime-unproven: both FFmpeg and Chrome open fresh VA contexts per
geometry, so the fallback never fired (0 occurrences in 90 s of Chrome DRC).
The code path is reviewed and logged, but no client exercised it yet.
Accordingly zero-copy stays an explicit `h264-no-b-v1` opt-in; the default
launcher and package are unchanged.

## Full Fluster driver-path runs (2026-09-08, current build)

Same target and boot ID as the zero-copy requalification above; every run
guarded (boot/temperature), no reset. Driver path is `FFmpeg-*-VAAPI`
through this driver; firmware baseline is `GStreamer-*-V4L2` on the same
firmware and resources, bypassing the driver.

| Suite | Driver path (FFmpeg-VAAPI) | Firmware (GStreamer-V4L2) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JVT-AVC_V1 H.264 (135) | 7 pass / 8 fail / 120 error | 40 pass (matches 2026-08-30) |
| JCT-VC-HEVC_V1 HEVC (147) | 20 pass / 18 fail / 108 error / 1 timeout | 112 pass (matches 2026-08-30) |

The firmware numbers reproduce 2026-08-30 exactly, including the hard
`gst-launch` rejects on SVC (H.264) and WPP (HEVC) vectors. VA-pass is a
strict subset of firmware-pass: the driver never passes what the firmware
cannot do.

Gap analysis on sampled vectors (native `h264_v4l2m2m` / manual VAAPI
controls): CABA1_Sony_D, CVFC1_Sony_C, CAQP1_Sony_B fail at the firmware
too (pixel mismatch or abort), and CANL1_Sony_E aborts natively. These are
firmware capability boundaries, not driver regressions. Two vectors show the
gap is partly methodology: BA1_Sony_D is VAAPI-exact and stable across 3/3
manual runs (the fluster Fail is the known nondeterministic wrapper
verdict from 2026-08-30), and AMP_A_Samsung_7 (Main 8-bit) is VAAPI-exact
while fluster reports Error. The Fluster FFmpeg wrapper turns software
fallback ("Failed setup for format") into Error, so unadvertised profiles
(Main10 and friends, deliberately outside the production matrix) inflate
the Error column by design.

No evidence was found of the driver aborting decodable content: matrices,
browser runs, soaks and the manual VAAPI controls are all green and stable.
Per the standing classification, `iris-matrix.sh` remains the authoritative
VA pixel oracle; these corpus runs are diagnostics.

## Pre-rebuild baseline (2026-09-20, tag `pre-rebuild-20260920`)

This is the tracked reference every rebuild phase is diffed against. It was
produced by the new `test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh`, which reports the
decoder Chrome itself selected, the platform flag, the frame/drop delta over
the window, the Chrome process type holding the Iris node, and the SHA-256 of
the driver the GPU process mapped. All four runs use the packaged default
environment: no `V4L2_VA_*` switch is set.

Target: Fedora 44 ARM64 on SM8550, kernel `7.2.2-sm8550-gad75da3-pr4+`
(self-built from ianchb/sm8550-mainline, Iris as a module, no decode-order
patch), boot ID `5b9707b3-22ad-4b32-ac5e-da3ff7cb6077` (unchanged through

The installed package was built from `fc680d6` with a dirty tree; the HEAD
build is the same tree at `05964d5`. Both pass identically, so the
zero-copy refresh in `05964d5` did not change the default path. This is the
first tracked HEVC-in-Chrome frame evidence; earlier HEVC browser results
lived only in an untracked log.

## Phase 1: decode-order Iris kernel module (2026-09-20)

The two decoder-side kernel changes from `strongtz/libva-v4l2` (decode-order
output through `V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_DEC_DISPLAY_DELAY{,_ENABLE}`, and a
64-buffer CAPTURE `max_num_buffers` for HFI gen2) were applied to the
tablet's kernel source (`ianchb/sm8550-mainline`, branch `sheng-7.2.2-pr4`,
HEAD `ad75da348a02`) with fuzz. One hunk of `iris_platform_common.h`
landed the two new capability IDs in `enum platform_inst_fw_cap_flags`
instead of `enum platform_inst_fw_cap_type`; they were moved by hand to the
end of the type enum. Only the `qcom-iris` module was rebuilt (`make LLVM=1
M=drivers/media/platform/qcom/iris modules`, zero warnings) and installed in
place; the previous module, the full local kernel diff and a `ROLLBACK.sh`
are kept under `$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/kernel-rollback-20260920/`.

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| module SHA-256 | `4b3087803c4b…` | `1c1a4ef99a5f…` |
| `display_delay` / `display_delay_enable` controls | absent | present (`max=0`, `default=0`) |
| `min_number_of_capture_buffers` | `max=32` | `max=32` (this control reports the firmware minimum's range; the vb2 pool limit is a separate REQBUFS bound and is verified in Phase 2's unit and hardware tests) |

The module was reloaded without a reboot (boot ID
`5b9707b3-22ad-4b32-ac5e-da3ff7cb6077` unchanged). With the control left at
its default, the unchanged installed driver passes the browser gate exactly as
in the pre-rebuild baseline:

| Run | Decoder | Platform | Frames / dropped (30 s) | Node holder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| patched module, installed driver, H.264 | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 671 / 0 | `--type=gpu-process` |
| patched module, installed driver, HEVC | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 672 / 0 | `--type=gpu-process` |

## Phase 3: rebuilt driver on the new core (2026-09-20)

Source commit range `1f1f2fa..f6642b1` on `main`; the driver is now
`src/va` on `src/iris` with `src/codec` translators (docs/architecture.md).
Target as in Phase 1, patched `qcom-iris` module (`1c1a4ef9…`), decode-order
mode active. The tablet rebooted at 14:12 local by a clean `systemd-reboot`
(previous boot's journal ends in an orderly shutdown; no Iris or firmware
message precedes it); every run below is on boot ID
`4944865b-f3b2-424b-8853-375f29bba7b4` and none changed it.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `meson test` on host | 15/15 including the 19-case FakeDevice session suite |
| `test/iris-matrix.sh` | H.264 48/48 and HEVC 48/48 exact framemd5; `submitted=48 capture=48 drain=1 timeouts=0 drops=0` each |
| `test/iris-structure-matrix.sh` | all-I, IP/GOP12, B2, B4 at 640x360: 48/48 each, zero drops or timeouts |
| `test/iris-zero-copy-suite.sh` (Direct path) | 24/24 frames `publish=direct`, zero copies, framemd5 equals software |
| `test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh` | native 202/100 switches; VA single-process 202 frames, 101 contexts, pixels equal software |

| Chrome 152 H.264 1080p24 B-frames, `V4L2_VA_TRACE=1` | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 719 frames / 0 dropped; trace: 920 `publish=copy-gpu`, 0 drops, 0 timeouts, 1 drain |
| Chrome 152 HEVC 1080p24 B-frames, traced | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 719 / 0; 919 `publish=copy-gpu`, 0 drops, 0 timeouts, 1 drain |
| `iris-ending-check`, `iris-context-retirement-check` on both Chrome traces | pass |

FFmpeg 1080p H.264, 240 frames, CPU time of the ffmpeg process (bash `time`):

| Path | user | sys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct (no copy) | 1.22 s | 0.43 s |
| Copy, GPU engine | 0.75 s | 0.47 s |
| Copy, CPU engine | 1.17 s | 0.38 s |
| Software decode | 2.80 s | 0.18 s |

The GPU engine's pixels are bit-identical to software for 48 frames. Chrome
pre-exports its pool and therefore runs the GPU-copy path; FFmpeg runs
Direct.

Two things learned on hardware and fixed in this phase: FFmpeg destroys a
resolution segment's VA context before downloading that segment's last
pictures, so a completed Direct frame must survive `vaDestroyContext`
(vb2 orphans exported buffers, the fd keeps the pixels); and the soak's own
libx265 encode leaves the prime core at the 85 C guard, so a scenario now
waits for a 15 C margin before its first sample.

Not yet done in this phase: VP9 and AV1 stay unadvertised (Phase 5);
`data/iris-codec-capabilities.json`, the launcher, packaging and the README
prose still describe the old tree (Phase 6).

## Phase 5: VP9 and AV1 on the new core (2026-09-20)

Same target and boot (`4944865b…`) as Phase 3; every run below is on the
decode-order module. Runs marked *guarded* went through
`scripts/iris-experiment-guard.sh` (boot ID and thermal watch).

### VP9: qualified, now advertised by default

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `test/iris-matrix.sh` VP9 (640x360, 48 frames) | 48/48 exact framemd5, `submitted=48 capture=48 drain=1 timeouts=0 drops=0` |
| 100 VA context recreations, guarded | first run 10/100 FFmpeg failures; root cause a race between FFmpeg's filter-thread `vaSyncSurface` and its decoder-thread `vaDestroyContext` (the context left the table before draining). Fixed in `va: drain before removing a context from the table`; rerun 0/100 failures, boot unchanged |
| `test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh` VP9, guarded | native baseline 202 frames / 100 switches; VA single-process 202 frames, 101 contexts, pixels equal software; VA new-context 100 transitions all 2/2 |
| Chrome 152, 1080p24 VP9 with alt-ref (`lag-in-frames 25`, `auto-alt-ref 1`), 30 s | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 716 frames / 0 dropped; trace 932 `publish=copy-gpu`, 0 drops, 0 timeouts |

The old tree withdrew VP9 because context recreation and source changes
rebooted the tablet. Neither reproduced in 200 recreations plus 100
in-stream resolution switches on the patched module. Whether the cause was
the display-order firmware path or the old driver's queue handling is not
separated here; the combination that ships is the one that was tested.

### AV1: firmware output contract, kept opt-in

The OBU writer now reconstructs global motion parameters (the previous
tree rejected any non-identity `wmtype`). Software oracle
(`test/av1-obu-roundtrip.sh`): 27 rebuilt temporal units, every one
bit-exact against libdav1d's decode of the source. The same rebuilt stream
fed to the firmware natively (`v4l2av1dec`) decodes to 27 frames with no
error; the original stream decodes natively to 48.

The 21-frame difference is the AV1 hidden-frame model: libaom emits
alt-ref frames with `show_frame=0` and later displays them through
`show_existing_frame`, a header-only temporal unit that carries no
payload and never reaches a VA-API hardware accelerator (VA has no call
for it). The firmware returns a CAPTURE buffer only for shown frames, so
through VA a client submits 48 pictures and receives 27 completions;
FFmpeg then times out on the first hidden one. A plain IPPP stream
(`lag-in-frames 0`, `auto-alt-ref 0`) exposes a second gap: the firmware
returned the key frame's CAPTURE only after the next AU was queued
(`va frames=1` at the first download), so even show-every-frame AV1 does
not satisfy VA's synchronous per-picture model on this firmware.

AV1 therefore stays behind `V4L2_VA_EXPERIMENTAL_PROFILES=1`. Closing it
needs either firmware/kernel support for returning hidden pictures (a
`DISPLAY_DELAY`-style control for AV1) or a VA client contract that
tolerates missing completions; neither is a driver change.

### AV1 recheck on the encode branch (2026-10-22)

Re-run against `3b91519` with the same build as the encode section
(`v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
`bb4549260f2c6d7b021889d3222e386cfe19735ea61282d93cf97c9e577daed9`,
FFmpeg 8.1.3, 320x240, 30 frames, `V4L2_VA_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS=500`). The
failure comes before the hidden-frame gap and is not specific to alt-ref
streams:

| Clip | Result |
| --- | --- |
| libaom default (`auto-alt-ref` on) | `Error processing packet in decoder: Input/output error`, no frames |
| `-lag-in-frames 0 -auto-alt-ref 0` | same error at the first download, no frames |

The trace pins it at picture one: `va end_picture … deferred` is followed
by `va error where=getImage … surface has no decoded pixels`, and the
translator releases that picture only when its successor arrives
(`submit token=1`). The one-picture hold is not removable — the VA AV1
picture buffer carries no `refresh_frame_flags`, and the slot a picture
writes is only visible in the next picture's reference map. Separately,
the one access unit that was submitted produced no CAPTURE before STOP
(`drain complete … output_queued=0`), the firmware deferral recorded
above.

AV1 VA decode therefore fails on the first picture of every stream on
this firmware, alt-ref or not. The conclusion is unchanged: opt-in only.

## Phase 6: trimmed tree, packaged, installed (2026-09-20)

The tree now contains only what the rebuilt driver ships (commit `069a58c`
and the docs pass `25dd21b`). Host gates: `meson test` 13/13, static checks
pass, `ldd -r` clean, no gstreamer/udev linkage.

Fedora RPM built on the target from `git archive` of HEAD through
`packaging/fedora/libva-v4l2-iris.spec` (EGL/GLESv2/GBM build deps, one
desktop entry), installed with `dnf reinstall`, `rpm -V` clean. Installed
driver SHA-256 `fe3acad292835061460f6455d080c368b5319ce10aad6ba0786eb37afe354c50`.
`vainfo` on the installed driver lists H.264 CBP/Main/High, HEVC Main/Main10,
VP9 Profile 0/2 and no AV1.

Acceptance from the installed package, no build-tree override, no
`V4L2_VA_*` switch, boot ID `4944865b…` unchanged:

| Clip (30 s window) | Decoder | Platform | Frames / dropped | Node holder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 718 / 4 | `--type=gpu-process` |
| HEVC 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 720 / 0 | `--type=gpu-process` |
| VP9 1080p24 alt-ref | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 718 / 0 | `--type=gpu-process` |

The four dropped H.264 frames were the only non-zero drop count in the
rebuild series; that run shared the tablet with the RPM install's
post-transaction work. A rerun on the idle tablet from the same installed
package: `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 720 / 0.

Three stale per-user desktop entries from earlier installs
(`chromium-iris-v4l2`, `chromium-iris-vulkan-webgpu`,
`google-chrome-iris-vulkan-webgpu`) were removed from
`~/.local/share/applications` on the target; the package ships only
`google-chrome-iris-v4l2.desktop`.

## Phase 7: 10-bit, conformance corpus, module provenance (2026-09-21)

Same target and boot ID (`4944865b…`) as Phases 3 to 6; every corpus run
guarded, no reset.

### 10-bit profiles

HEVC Main10 and VP9 Profile 2 decode bit-exact against software (48 frames
each, P010 CAPTURE at 128-pixel stride) once two glue defects were fixed:
the session took its CAPTURE fourcc from the config instead of the first
target surface, and the surface attribute list offered only NV12 to
clients that create a config without an RT-format attribute (FFmpeg). A
1080p24 Main10 B-frame stream plays in Chrome 152 as `VaapiVideoDecoder`,
platform=true, on the GPU copy engine with P010 stable buffers (three
runs: 720/4, 719/3, 719/0 dropped; the 8-bit control in the same session
showed 719/2, so the drops track tablet load, not bit depth).

### Fluster conformance, driver path (`FFmpeg-*-VAAPI`)

Firmware baseline is the 2026-09-08 `GStreamer-*-V4L2` run on the same
resources (the native path, bypassing this driver).

| Suite | Old driver (2026-09-08) | Rebuilt driver, first run | Rebuilt driver, final | Firmware |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JVT-AVC_V1 (135) | 7 pass | 40 pass | 40 pass | 40 pass |
| JCT-VC-HEVC_V1 (147) | 20 pass | 57 pass | 111 pass | 112 pass |

H.264: the VA pass set equals the firmware pass set exactly; the 95 others
fail natively too (SVC, interlaced, FMO/ASO and other tools the firmware
does not implement).

HEVC: the first rebuilt run already tripled the old count. The remaining
gap was closed in three steps found by classifying every failing vector's
trace: (1) the generated SPS carried one repeated RPS with only the
current picture's references, which evicted follow pictures and broke any
stream whose slices index different sets; every slice header is now
rewritten with an explicit RPS built from VA's DPB (used flags, long-term
entries) and VA's RefPicList spelled out as a list modification, the
approach strongtz/libva-v4l2 uses; (2) FFmpeg renders one slice data
buffer per slice while the translator assumed one blob for the picture;
(3) three PPS fields were clamped inside their legal ranges
(`init_qp_minus26` for 10-bit, `diff_cu_qp_delta_depth`,
`log2_parallel_merge_level_minus2`).

Final state: 111/147. The two firmware-passing vectors the driver does
not pass (`NUT_A_ericsson_5`, `RPS_D_ericsson_6`) decode all frames
without a firmware error and match software frame for frame under
`framemd5`; Fluster reports them as failing because FFmpeg's software
reference decoder itself logs "Could not find ref with POC" on both and
emits a different frame set than the conformance MD5. `RAP_A_docomo_6`
passes through the driver (RASL pictures after the opening CRA are refused
by the translator, so the output starts where the reference does) while
the native GStreamer path emitted one frame fewer. `DELTAQP_A_BRCM_4`,
`INITQP_B_Main10_Sony_1` and `PMERGE_E_TI_3` complete every frame with no
firmware error but were recorded here as differing in pixels; the recheck
of 2026-10-22 shows that was a measurement artifact and all three match
byte for byte (see "HEVC conformance recheck" below).

The HEVC parameter-set unit test is registered again (it had been dropped
from `test/meson.build` in Phase 3).

### Provenance

`test/remote/provenance.py` records the installed `qcom-iris` module path
and SHA-256 alongside the kernel release, so a result carries the
decode-order patch identity.

### Final installed package (2026-09-21)

RPM rebuilt from `adba51f` and reinstalled; `rpm -V` clean; installed
driver `579d1bc1fa18af5e…`, manifest source commit matches. Chrome 152
from the installed package, packaged defaults, boot ID unchanged:

| Clip | Decoder | Frames / dropped (30 s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 708 / 2 |
| HEVC Main 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 714 / 0 |
| VP9 1080p24 alt-ref | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 720 / 0 |
| HEVC Main10 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 720 / 3 |

A full-duration (2 h per scenario) `iris-concurrency-soak.sh` against the
installed driver, started after this table on the same boot (`4944865b…`),
passed: `dual-h264` 172800 + 172800 frames and `mixed` H.264 172800 +
HEVC 172800 frames, `teardown_timeouts=0`, `stateful_drain_complete=1` on
all four contexts, hottest zone 57.6 °C, boot ID unchanged. Log:
`$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/artifacts/final-soak-2h-20260921.log`.

## Kernel 7.2.6 and the re-applied decode-order module (2026-09-22)

On 2026-09-21 the target moved from the self-built `7.2.2-sm8550-gad75da3-pr4+`
kernel to the packaged `kernel-sheng-7.2.6-1`
(`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40c702a`). That package ships the stock Iris module, so
the decode-order patch from Phase 1 was gone: no `display_delay` control,
the driver fell back to display-order mode. Every result above this heading
was produced on the patched 7.2.2 kernel.

The two strongtz patches were rebased onto the 7.2.6 tree
(`packaging/kernel/0001-media-iris-decode-order-output-and-64-capture-buffers.patch`;
one enum hunk had to be placed by hand, the fuzzy apply put
`DISPLAY_DELAY*` into `platform_inst_fw_cap_flags` instead of
`platform_inst_fw_cap_type`) and only the `qcom-iris` module rebuilt. Two
things bit on the way and are recorded so nobody repeats them:

- The kernel is built with `CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL`. Kconfig silently
  drops that option under clang 22 (`CLANG_VERSION < 210000` guard), so a
  module built from the same `.config` lacks BTI landing pads and the first
  instruction of `init_module` oopses (`Oops - BTI`). Building with
  `KCFLAGS=-mbranch-protection=pac-ret+bti` fixes it; check with
  `llvm-readelf -n qcom-iris.ko` (`aarch64 feature: BTI, PAC`).
- After the oops the module is stuck in `initstate=coming` and
  `modprobe -r` hangs in `iris_vpu_power_off → disable_irq`; the same hang
  happens on any `modprobe -r` while the VPU is powered. Swap the file and
  reboot instead of reloading. `ROLLBACK.sh` under
  `$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/kernel-rollback-20260921-7.2.6/` does exactly that.

Installed module sha `86e5e49aec0d…` (stock `548170065d83…` kept beside
it). After a clean boot (`0bdad14e…`) `/dev/video7` exposes
`display_delay` / `display_delay_enable`, `min_number_of_capture_buffers`
max 32.

### Installed package on kernel 7.2.6 (2026-09-22)

Unchanged installed driver `579d1bc1fa18…` (RPM `libva-v4l2-iris-0.1.0-1`),
Chrome 152 through the packaged launcher, 30 s windows, boot ID unchanged
throughout:

| Clip | Decoder | Frames / dropped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 719 / 18, then 718 / 0 and 719 / 0 |
| HEVC Main 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 718 / 0 |
| VP9 1080p24 alt-ref | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 720 / 6, then 719 / 0 |
| HEVC Main10 1080p24 B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true | 720 / 0 |

The two non-zero drop counts were the first runs after the reboot (load
average above 10 for the first minutes); the immediate reruns were clean.

### Target cleanup (2026-09-22)

The pre-RPM install path had left five desktop entries under
`/usr/local/share/applications` (two Chromium ones whose `TryExec` pointed
at a browser that is not installed, the Vulkan/WebGPU experiments, a
Chromium 154 entry for a build that no longer exists) and a stale driver at
`/usr/local/lib64/dri/v4l2_drv_video.so`. They were moved to
`$IRIS_LAB_ROOT/residue-backup-20260922/`, not deleted. What remains:
the RPM's `google-chrome-iris-v4l2.desktop`, the user-level
`google-chrome.desktop` override that routes the plain Chrome icon through
`iris-vaapi-browser`, and Fedora's own `chromium-browser.desktop`.

## Client-owned CAPTURE buffers (Import): the §9 gate and the verdict (2026-09-22)

Branch `iris/zero-copy`. Target, module and driver: boot `0bdad14e…`,
`qcom-iris` `86e5e49a…` (decode-order), driver build `2796989e…`.

The gate the architecture doc demands is `test/iris-import-probe.cc`: a
standalone V4L2 program that feeds a stream whose every picture's luma is a
flat grey encoding its decode-order index, queues one client DMA-BUF per
access unit before the unit, and compares each completion's token with the
token its buffer was queued for.

What it measured:

| Configuration | Wrong association |
| --- | --- |
| 1:1 queue-at-submit, 8-16 surfaces, no holes, B-frames | 246/360 |
| ... bounded to 2-3 buffers in flight | 246-353/360 (pairwise swaps) |
| 300 s Chrome, H.264 b3, holes allowed (released surfaces) | 96-272 misplaced |

The pixels themselves are always correct: for a given token the grey is
identical across runs with different surface counts (360/360), and
completions arrive strictly in decode order. The firmware chooses which
queued CAPTURE buffer a picture lands in; the completion names the picture
(token/timestamp), not the buffer.

Two rules then make the association exact, both measured:

1. **One client buffer in flight.** The next buffer goes in only after the
   previous completion, so the firmware has no second buffer to choose.
2. **No holes.** A picture whose surface the client released still gets its
   buffer (the backlog holds an owned fd duplicate); skipping it shifted
   every later completion into a neighbour's buffer, permanently.

With both, on Chrome 152 (30 s windows, platform decoder, GPU process on
the Iris node, boot unchanged):

| Stream | Import publishes | Misplaced | Dropped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 1080p24 B-frames | 901 | 0 | 0 |
| Frame-index 1080p30 B-frames | 1125 | 0 | 0 |
| HEVC Main 1080p24 B-frames | 905 | 0 | 0 |
| HEVC Main10 1080p24 B-frames | 907 | 0 | 0 |
| VP9 1080p24 alt-ref | not enabled (Copy) | — | see below |

FFmpeg through Import decodes bit-exactly (`framemd5` identical to the
software decoder, H.264 and HEVC); the 6-switch dynamic-resolution suite
passes in Import mode.

VP9 under Import was chased to its mechanism on 2026-09-22 and stays
excluded:

- a one-buffer window stalls Chrome's VP9 session ~500 ms on every alt-ref
  access unit (the superframe decodes as two pictures and the second has no
  buffer to land in); measured gaps of 477-500 ms at tokens 14, 28, 55, 77,
  ... and a drain failure at teardown; FFmpeg's VP9 through Import is
  unaffected (204/204, `framemd5` identical, 1.7 s wall for 8 s of video).
- a two-buffer window removes the stall (714/719 frames in 30 s) but
  reintroduces the firmware's own buffer choice: 153/609 and 159/599
  misplaced in two runs, matching the probe's finding that association is
  only determined when the firmware has no choice.
- the fix therefore belongs in the VP9 translator (one access unit per
  picture instead of an alt-ref superframe), not in the session.

Verdict: the policy exists, with the two rules enforced in the session and
the misplaced-completion check (both surfaces involved are failed, never
published) as the fail-closed backstop. `V4L2_VA_PUBLISH=import` forces it;
`auto` selects it for H.264/HEVC/Main10 on a decode-order kernel and keeps
Copy for VP9 and for display-order kernels.

## Merge gate: the trunk with the Import policy (2026-09-22)

Branch `main` at `6dd8bd2` (the zero-copy work merged), driver
`f9f4e423050f…` built clean on the target (`ldd -r` reports no undefined
symbols), boot ID `5a337970…` unchanged through every run.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Codec matrix | 15 PASS, 0 FAIL: H.264 / VP9 / HEVC 48/48 frames each, exact frame MD5 against the native V4L2 decoders, AV1 lane included |
| Structure matrix | pass |
| Dynamic resolution (H.264, 100 switches) | pass, 101 fresh contexts, no timeout |
| Chrome 152, auto policy | H.264 902 import, HEVC 905 import, Main10 898 import, VP9 908 copy-gpu; 0 misplaced, 0 decode errors, all platform decoder with the GPU process holding the Iris node |

Chrome's own dropped-frame counts in those 30 s windows were 2, 2, 1 and 0.

### Merge gate continued: soak, package, installed acceptance (2026-09-22)

- Bounded soak on the merged trunk: `dual-h264`, 120 s per context, 2880
  frames each, `teardown_timeouts=0`, `stateful_drain_complete=1`, hottest
  zone 43 °C, boot ID unchanged.
- RPM rebuilt from the merged tree (`source_commit=18be55a`, tracked-source
  hash recorded in the install manifest), reinstalled; `rpm -V` clean. The
  installed ELF hash differs from the build tree by design: the spec
  post-processes the staged runtime module (see the spec header).
- Installed-package acceptance, no `--driver` override, auto policy:
  H.264 902 import, HEVC 906 import, Main10 898 import, VP9 915 copy-gpu;
  0 misplaced, 0 decode errors, `VaapiVideoDecoder`, GPU process holding
  the node, boot unchanged. The Import path is now the shipped default
  where the evidence allows it.

## Encode entrypoint: H.264 and HEVC (2026-10-22)

Implementation commit `f63afe0` on `feat/encode-entrypoints`. Target:
Fedora 44 ARM64 on SM8550 (`sheng`), kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot ID
`32b1c05f-5043-4799-acd2-d4b0ec6f0e10` unchanged through every run.
Decoder and encoder nodes resolved by the `iris_driver` QUERYCAP name:
`/dev/video0` (`Iris Decoder`) and `/dev/video1` (`Iris Encoder`). The
driver under test was `build-encode/src/v4l2_drv_video.so`, SHA-256
`bb4549260f2c6d7b021889d3222e386cfe19735ea61282d93cf97c9e577daed9`,
selected with `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2 LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=<build>/src`.
No installed package was involved in this section.

`vainfo` lists `VAEntrypointEncSlice` next to `VAEntrypointVLD` for H.264
Constrained Baseline, Main and High and for HEVC Main. VP9 and AV1 get no
encode entrypoint: the encoder node's CAPTURE queue enumerates H264 and
HEVC only (`iris_venc.c`, `iris_venc_formats_cap`) and its raw queue NV12
and QC08C (`iris_venc_formats_out`), so there is no hardware path to
advertise.

| Run | Frames in/out | Bytes | Iris IRQ delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `h264_vaapi` 1920x1080, 4 Mbit/s VBR, GOP 60 | 300/300 | 9,918,858 | 7441 → 8049 (+608) |
| `hevc_vaapi` 1920x1080, 4 Mbit/s VBR, GOP 60 | 300/300 | 9,966,042 | 8050 → 8660 (+610) |
| `h264_vaapi` 1920x1080, CBR 4 Mbit/s, High, level 4.1 | 300/300 | 4,988,651 | — |
| `h264_vaapi` 1280x720, 2 Mbit/s VBR, GOP 30 | 120/120 | 2,003,275 | — |
| `hevc_vaapi` 1280x720, 2 Mbit/s VBR, GOP 30 | 120/120 | 2,005,117 | — |
| `h264_vaapi` 640x360, 1 Mbit/s VBR, GOP 15 | 30/30 | 118,372 (last run of the loop below) | — |

Every stream decodes with `ffmpeg -v error -i <out> -f null -` and reports
the requested geometry, profile and level:

- H.264 VBR: High, level 4.0, 1920x1080, 300 frames. Key frames at 0, 61,
  122, 183, 244: the firmware counts the IDR inside `GOP_SIZE`, so
  programming `intra_period` directly put them one frame late. The session
  now programs `intra_period - 1`; the acceptance run below shows
  0, 60, 120, 180, 240.
- H.264 CBR with `-profile:v high -level 4.1`: High, level 4.1,
  1920x1080, 300 frames. The byte count is 3.99 Mbit/s over the 10 s of
  content, which is the requested CBR target.
- HEVC VBR: Main, level 4.0, 1920x1080, 300 frames.
- 720p: both codecs report 1280x720, 120 frames. The raw port was
  aligned to 1280x736 and the crop kept the SPS at 720 lines.
- 640x360: 640x360, 30 frames.

The SPS VUI carries `num_units_in_tick=2097152`, `time_scale=125829120`
(30 fps), which is what `S_PARM` on the CAPTURE queue produced. Raw
H.264/HEVC demuxers report 25 fps because they do not read the VUI; the
remux below shows the intended rate.

Context lifetime: ten consecutive 720p `h264_vaapi` runs (create context,
ten pictures, destroy) all exited 0 with no driver error in `dmesg`, and
the last stream decodes clean.

Remux with no extradata: `ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i enc.h264 -c copy
enc.mp4` and the same for HEVC both produce MP4s whose `ffprobe` shows
30 fps and non-zero extradata (46 and 127 bytes) built from the Annex-B
parameter sets, and which decode without error.

Negative results, as designed:

- `-bf 2` is silently clamped by FFmpeg to no B frames; a client that
  sends `ip_period > 1` gets `VA_STATUS_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`.
- `VAConfigAttribEncPackedHeaders` is `VA_ATTRIB_NOT_SUPPORTED`, so
  FFmpeg warns "Driver does not support any packed headers (wanted
  0xd)" once and continues with the firmware's own parameter sets.
- A 16384x16384 source is rejected by `testsrc2` before the driver sees
  it; the driver's own bound is the node's 8192.

### Decode regression

The encode work changes `vaDeriveImage` from a snapshot copy to a view
over the surface's DMA-BUF, and changes node discovery. Both are
decode-visible, so the decode gates ran again on the same build:

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `test/iris-matrix.sh` | H.264, HEVC and VP9 48/48 frames each, exact frame MD5 against the native V4L2 decoders; AV1 lane unchanged |
| Chrome 152.0.7977.82, 20 s window, build-tree driver | H.264 `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 599 frames, 4 dropped, GPU process holding the node; HEVC `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, 601 frames, 2 dropped |
| Firefox 158.0, H.264 clip | VA session through the driver (`session open node=/dev/video0 codec=H264 1920x1088`, `submit`, `capture configure`), playback advanced to 13.7 s |
| Chromium 152.0.7977.75 | `FFmpegVideoDecoder`, platform=false: the launcher's documented software fallback for Fedora Chromium ≥ 152, not a driver result |

Firefox needed `LIBVA_V4L2_VIDEO_PATH` and `MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX=1`:
with the RDD sandbox on, the driver's `/dev/video*` scan is denied in that
process. That is a pre-existing sandbox boundary, not an encode change.

### What the traces showed

- The SM8550 encoder firmware sends no frame info, so
  `V4L2_BUF_FLAG_KEYFRAME` is always clear on a CAPTURE completion. The
  `encode frame` record therefore carries no key flag; the IDR NAL in the
  stream is the evidence.
- FFmpeg renders the sequence parameter buffer with the IDR only. The
  context retains that buffer, otherwise the second picture fails with
  "no sequence parameters".
- FFmpeg declares an aligned context (1920x1088) and feeds 1920x1080
  frames. The encoder geometry therefore comes from the input surface,
  with the context as the upper bound; a later surface of a different
  size is rejected because the node has no `SOURCE_CHANGE`.

### Piano acceptance: CQP, GOP cadence, decoded pixels (2026-10-22)

The piano project's `scripts/verify-device-media.py` is the acceptance
bar this driver has to clear: 300 frames of 1080p H.264 and HEVC through
`h264_vaapi`/`hevc_vaapi` with no `-b:v` (FFmpeg selects CQP), MP4
output, key frames at 0/60/120/180/240, and 300 decoded frames whose
per-frame MD5 matches a software decode. The driver failed it twice
before this run: `VA_RC_CQP` was not advertised, so the encoder would
not open at all, and the IDRs landed at 61/122/... with `-g 60`.

With CQP, the `intra_period - 1` GOP mapping, and the CAPTURE format
re-set after the rate-control controls, on the same target:

| Run | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `h264_vaapi`, 1920x1080, no bitrate, `-bf 0 -g 60`, 300 frames, MP4 | 17,138,094 bytes, Iris IRQ +610, key frames 0/60/120/180/240 |
| `hevc_vaapi`, the same | 13,171,327 bytes, Iris IRQ +609, the same key frames |
| `h264_v4l2m2m` decode of the H.264 file | 300 frames, every frame MD5 equal to the software decode, Iris IRQ +614 |
| `h264_v4l2m2m` decode of the HEVC file | 300 frames, MD5 equal, Iris IRQ +840 |
| `ffmpeg -hwaccel vaapi` (this driver) decode of the H.264 file | 300 frames, MD5 equal |

Source `3b91519` plus the CQP/GOP change (uncommitted at the time of the
run), driver `build-encode/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
`5805975ab3338e4ebcefac6c126546bb0be015eb8c213be5fb983f3a53d28b33`,
kernel `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot ID
`32b1c05f-5043-4799-acd2-d4b0ec6f0e10` (unchanged).

CQP honors the client QP: 60 frames of 1080p H.264 are 5,445,355 bytes
at `-q:v 10`, 3,398,734 at the default and 244,736 at `-q:v 45`. FFmpeg
still warns that no packed headers are advertised; MP4 muxing succeeds
because the muxer derives `avcC`/`hvcC` from the Annex-B parameter sets
in the stream, but the encoder offers no extradata at open time.

Not covered: a per-picture IDR request (`-force_key_frames`, seeks). The
running kernel has no `V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_FORCE_KEY_FRAME`, so the
periodic IDR is the only keyframe source.

## Decode throughput and the build type (2026-10-22)

A user-space cost measurement taken while investigating decode throughput.
The clips are `/tmp/iris-enc/media/clip-{hevc,h264}.mp4`: 1920x1080, 900
frames, decoded 300 frames each with `-hwaccel vaapi
-hwaccel_output_format vaapi -f null`, so the frames stay on the VA surface
and nothing is downloaded. Wall clock and CPU come from `-benchmark`; the
native rows are `-c:v {hevc,h264}_v4l2m2m` timed with the shell.

| Decoder | HEVC rtime / utime | H.264 rtime / utime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| This driver, `buildtype=debug` (`-O0`) | 6.569 s / 5.458 s | 1.132 s / 0.945 s |
| This driver, `buildtype=debugoptimized` (`-O2`) | 0.453 s / 0.279 s | 0.515 s / 0.123 s |
| Installed RPM driver (2026-09-02, `-O2`) | 0.607 s / 0.462 s | 0.514 s / 0.131 s |
| `hevc_v4l2m2m` / `h264_v4l2m2m` | 0.624 s / 0.168 s | 0.673 s / 0.146 s |

The same driver source at `-O0` is 14x slower on HEVC and 2.2x on H.264.
On the whole 900-frame clip the optimised driver holds 778 fps on HEVC
(1.156 s) and 637 fps on H.264 (1.414 s).
Temporary timers inside `vaEndPicture` located the cost in
`translator->translate` itself: 10.4 ms per HEVC frame at `-O0` against
0.62 ms at `-O2`, with `submit` at 0.96 ms against 0.39 ms. The
instrumentation was removed after the measurement.

Meson's own default is `-O0`, so `meson setup build` as documented in the
README produced an unoptimised driver. `meson.build` now sets
`default_options: ['buildtype=debugoptimized']`. The installed RPM was
built by rpmbuild's own flags and is optimised, so no browser result in
this file changes; only source-tree builds were affected.

Driver `build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
`9e2ecbafcd49dafcf17e23782b66bbf5d82e08d9ea8b8de5483d495aa4c256b8`,
kernel `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot ID
`32b1c05f-5043-4799-acd2-d4b0ec6f0e10`, decoder node resolved by
`iris_driver` name as before.

### 4K HEVC slice rewrite (2026-10-22)

The 1080p throughput above hid a second problem. Synthetic 4K clips
(testsrc2 3840x2160: H.264 from `libx264 -preset ultrafast -qp 20`,
HEVC from `libx265 -preset ultrafast crf=22 keyint=60`) decoded 60
frames bit-exactly through the VA path, with `hwdownload,format=nv12`
and `format=nv12` on the reference decode so both sides hash the same
layout:

| Clip | VA frames matching software |
| --- | --- |
| 4K H.264, 60 frames | 60/60 |
| 4K HEVC, 60 frames | 60/60 |

Throughput was not. Ten copies of the HEVC clip concatenated (600
frames, about 140 KB per slice) took 10.75 s, 9.06 s of it user CPU:
56 fps against 233 fps for `hevc_v4l2m2m` on the same file.
`HEVC::rewrite_slice` re-emits every slice because the original RPS
cannot be reproduced by a generated SPS, and it did that one bit at a
time through `BitWriter::bit` — 1.1 million calls per frame at that
size.

`BitReader::copy` now takes a whole-byte path when the reader position
and the writer are both byte-aligned, through a new `BitWriter::append`;
the reader also reserves the NAL size up front. The same 600 frames:

| | rtime | utime | fps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before | 10.750 s | 9.060 s | 56 |
| After | 3.447 s | 2.581 s | 172 |
| `hevc_v4l2m2m` | 2.572 s | 0.775 s | 233 |

Timers inside `vaEndPicture` put `translate` at 0.15 ms per 4K frame
with the clocks at their initial state and 1.5 ms after twenty seconds
of decoding, against 14 ms before the change; the part of the process
CPU that remains beyond the driver is FFmpeg's own VA-API HEVC parsing.
`test/hevc-parameter-sets-test.cc` now compares the fast path against a
per-bit copy over 18 spans, aligned and unaligned, before the driver is
allowed to use it.

Driver `build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
`d824cd5624c085ce210fa14f882363afe5dd4c2be3448afbe1e918c71f8d65f3`,
same kernel and boot ID as above.

## Client coverage and encode scale-out (2026-10-22)

Every run here used a staged install of the driver
(`DESTDIR=… IRIS_VA_DRIVER_DIR=/usr/lib64/dri scripts/install-system.sh
build-def`), which is also the only way the `msm_drv_video.so` alias exists.
`LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME` was unset throughout, so libva had to resolve the driver
by DRM name the way a client that knows nothing about this project does.
Driver SHA-256 `d824cd5624c085ce210fa14f882363afe5dd4c2be3448afbe1e918c71f8d65f3`,
kernel `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot
`32b1c05f-5043-4799-acd2-d4b0ec6f0e10`.

### Clients that set no environment

| Client | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FFmpeg | `-hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_device /dev/dri/renderD128` | decodes; used for every earlier row |
| Chrome 152 | `test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh --driver …/build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` | H.264 600 frames / 2 dropped, HEVC 600 / 2, `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform=true, GPU process holding the node |
| mpv v0.41 | `--hwdec=vaapi --vo=gpu --gpu-context=wayland`, desktop session | `Using hardware decoding (vaapi)`, 60 frames, 65 capture tokens; libva opened `msm_drv_video.so` and found our init function |
| VLC 3.0.24 | `cvlc --avcodec-hw=vaapi --vout=dummy`, desktop session | `Using Qualcomm Iris V4L2 stateful (libva-v4l2) for hardware decoding`, 60 frames, 61 capture tokens |
| GStreamer 1.28.8 | `filesrc ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! vah264dec ! fakesink` | H.264 100 frames / 101 capture tokens, HEVC 100 / 102 |

Two client-side gates are worth recording, because neither is visible from
the driver:

- GStreamer's VA plugin rejects any driver whose vendor string is not on its
  allow-list (`_gst_va_display_filter_driver`, `gstvadisplay.c:186`), and the
  `va` plugin then registers zero elements. `GST_VA_ALL_DRIVERS=1` overrides
  it; with that set, `vah264dec`/`vah265dec` appear and decode through Iris.
- GStreamer's VA **encoder** cannot start without
  `VAConfigAttribEncPackedHeaders` at all: `gst_va_display_get_packed_headers`
  fails, `_init_packed_headers` returns FALSE, and `gst_va_base_enc_reset`
  reports "Error at reconfiguration error" before any frame is submitted.
  This driver answers `VA_ATTRIB_NOT_SUPPORTED` there on purpose — the
  firmware writes SPS/PPS and the driver will not put a second, possibly
  disagreeing set in the stream. `vah264enc`/`vah265enc` therefore do not
  work. Radxa's backend answers `VA_ENC_PACKED_HEADER_NONE`, which fails the
  same check, so this is not a gap against libva-v4l2.

### MP4 without a remux

The earlier note that MP4 output needs a remux was wrong. FFmpeg warns
("No global header will be written") and then carries the parameter sets
in-band, extracting them from the first packet: a 120-frame 1280x720 encode
yields `extradata_size=43` for H.264 and `124` for HEVC, and both MP4 files
decode cleanly with no remux. The CQP path (no `-b:v`) behaves the same.

### Encode throughput, 4K, and two contexts at once

300 frames of `testsrc2`, CBR 12 Mbps, `-g 60`, NV12 uploaded from system
memory, `ffmpeg -benchmark`:

| Codec | 1920x1080 | 3840x2160 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 High | 1.872 s, 160 fps | 3.057 s, 98 fps |
| HEVC Main | 1.374 s, 218 fps | 2.816 s, 107 fps |

Every output decodes with no errors, and the IDRs land at
0/60/120/180/240 at both sizes. The 4K H.264 stream reports level 5.1 and
HEVC level 5.0, which is the encoder's choice for that geometry, not a
client request.

Two encodes in parallel on one node (H.264 8 Mbps at 1080p and HEVC 8 Mbps
at 1080p, 300 frames each) both exit 0, produce 19,933,115 and 19,914,057
bytes, decode cleanly, and move the Iris IRQ counter by 1,154 during the
pair. The session serialises each context internally; nothing in the two
runs reported a timeout or a dropped picture.

### HEVC conformance recheck: all three residuals are exact (2026-10-22)

Phase 7 recorded `DELTAQP_A_BRCM_4`, `INITQP_B_Main10_Sony_1` and
`PMERGE_E_TI_3` as decoding every frame without a firmware error but
differing in pixels, and left them unchased. Rechecked on the same target
with the current driver, they are exact.

The earlier comparison hashed `framemd5` straight out of each decoder. A
framemd5 is taken over the frame's planes at the decoder's linesize, so a
padding or stride difference between the VA surface and libavcodec's
frame changes the hash without changing a pixel: the streams report
different hashes for every frame, while a contiguous NV12 dump of the
whole stream is byte-identical. Normalising the software side with
`-vf format=nv12` and the VA side with `hwdownload,format=nv12` removes
the layout difference, and the hashes agree frame for frame:

| Vector | Frames | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DELTAQP_A_BRCM_4` (Main, 1920x1088) | 96 | MD5 identical, `nv12` |
| `PMERGE_E_TI_3` (Main, 416x240) | 8 | MD5 identical, `nv12` |
| `INITQP_B_Main10_Sony_1` (Main 10, 416x240) | 90 | MD5 identical, `p010le` |

`INITQP_B_Main10_Sony_1` also has to be downloaded as `p010le`: asking for
`nv12` from a 10-bit surface fails outright, which is what the earlier
"VA decode failed" line in this recheck first hit. No driver change was
needed. Use normalised output when comparing hashes across decoders; a
raw framemd5 compares frame layouts as much as pixels.

### Encoder control surface, rechecked (2026-10-22)

`v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 --list-ctrls` on the running module lists the GOP
size, `video_bitrate_mode` (VBR/CBR), the frame-level RC switch, the
sequence-header mode, the LTR controls and the H.264/HEVC profile, level and
QP controls. It lists no `force_key_frame`, no RAP control and no
`V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_FRAME_RATE`. That absence is a property of this kernel
branch, not of the firmware: 7.3-rc4's `inst_fw_cap_sm8550_enc[]` lists
`REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME` and `iris_ctrls.c` maps `V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_FORCE_KEY_FRAME`
onto it. The conclusion recorded here — that
on-demand IDR therefore stays unimplemented — was wrong about what the
absence rules out: the intra period is a GOP control the node does have,
and the session uses it for one picture. See "On-demand IDR by moving the
intra period" below. `intra_refresh_period` is still a different feature
(periodic intra refresh, not an IDR request) and is not used.

## Client requests the encoder cannot honour (2026-10-22)

QUERYCAP name: `/dev/video0` (`Iris Decoder`), `/dev/video1`

Two classes of gap against the reference driver (radxa `libva-v4l2`
1.0.0) closed in one change: a client's slice deblocking request was read
by nobody, and the other VA picture/slice fields that the firmware cannot
be told about were ignored silently.

The kernel this target runs exposes **no** loop-filter control on either
node: `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video1 --list-ctrls | grep -ciE
'loop_filter|lf_(tc|beta)'` is 0, and the same holds for the decoder node.
The firmware there always filters with the default 0/0 offsets, so the
driver forwards the request when those six controls exist and returns
`VA_STATUS_ERROR_UNIMPLEMENTED` when they do not — with one exception,
mode 2 (filtering off across slice boundaries only), which with one slice
per picture produces the same stream as mode 0 and is therefore accepted.
Mode 2 is not hypothetical: it is exactly what an HEVC client that leaves
`slice_loop_filter_across_slices_enabled_flag` clear normalises to, and
FFmpeg sends zeroed slice parameters, so HEVC encode on this target takes
that branch. The trace records which one ran:

```
encode deblocking mode=0 alpha=0 beta=0 via=default t=25     (h264_vaapi)
encode deblocking mode=2 alpha=0 beta=0 via=default t=21     (hevc_vaapi)
```

Every output decodes with `ffmpeg -v error -i <out> -f null -`, and the
two CQP files decode through this driver to 300 frames whose per-frame MD5
matches a software decode exactly (`hwdownload,format=nv12` on the VA
side, `format=nv12` on the software side). The CQP byte counts match the
earlier record to four significant figures (17,138,094 and 13,171,327 on
the pre-change build), which is what a change that only adds validation
should look like.

Profiles and the documented failure modes still behave:

| Run (1280x720, 60 frames) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `-profile:v constrained_baseline` | exits 0, 525,430 bytes, `ffprobe`: Constrained Baseline, level 3.1 |
| `-profile:v main` | exits 0, 522,808 bytes |
| `-bf 2` | exits 0, 523,190 bytes: FFmpeg clamps to no B frames before the driver sees it |
| `-slices 2` | fails in FFmpeg with `Invalid argument` before the driver sees it; the driver's own rule is `VA_STATUS_ERROR_UNIMPLEMENTED` for more than one slice |
| `-q:v 10` (CQP) | exits 0, 2,682,127 bytes for 60 frames |

`test/encode-params-test.cc` covers the translator's side of the refusals
(weighted prediction, scaling lists, chroma QP offsets, reference indexes,
a CABAC initialisation index, two slices, HEVC tiles, wavefront and
dependent slice segments). `test/unit/encode-session-test.cc` is new: a
scripted encoder node with and without the loop-filter controls, which
pins both halves of the deblocking promise — the three control writes with
their HEVC menu mapping, and the refusal when the controls are absent, plus
"changing deblocking mid-context needs a new context". `meson test` is
16/16 and `sh test/run-static-checks.sh` passes.

The refusal path is on the target as well, since no VA client there asks
for non-default deblocking and FFmpeg cannot be made to.
`test/iris-encode-control-probe.cc` (built, not registered as a meson
test: it needs the node) drives `EncoderSession` against the real encoder
node. Resolved by driver name, `/dev/video1`:

```
control h264_loop_filter_mode    absent
control h264_loop_filter_alpha   absent
control h264_loop_filter_beta    absent
control hevc_loop_filter_mode    absent
control hevc_lf_tc_offset_div2   absent
control hevc_lf_beta_offset_div2 absent
PASS h264: the kernel default deblocking request configures
PASS hevc: mode 2 configures (the request FFmpeg's zeroed slice parameters normalise to)
PASS h264: disabling deblocking is refused
PASS h264: a deblocking offset is refused
PASS hevc: disabling deblocking is refused
PASS node=/dev/video1 loop_filter_controls=absent h264_off=0x14 h264_alpha=0x14 hevc_off=0x14
```

`0x14` is `VA_STATUS_ERROR_UNIMPLEMENTED`. The probe expects that status
when the node reports the controls absent and success when it reports them
present, so it is a gate on either kind of kernel, and it configures and
tears down four real sessions on the way (STOP, drain, STREAMOFF).

only, no installed package. Nodes resolved by the `iris_driver` QUERYCAP
name: `/dev/video0` (`Iris Decoder`), `/dev/video1` (`Iris Encoder`).

`vaCreateSurfaces2` now takes the client's own DMA-BUF (DRM_PRIME_2
descriptor or PRIME_1 buffer table) instead of refusing it. The surface is
a view over that object in the CAPTURE layout, the fd is duplicated, and
`persistent_export` is set, so the decode path is the Import policy already
recorded above (2026-09-22) and the encode path is the ordinary input
surface. Everything below is `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2` with
`LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=<build>/src`.

`prime-import` (host, no hardware) is the layout and refusal contract:
the accepted composed-layer and two-layer forms for NV12 and P010, the
accepted PRIME_1 table, and every refusal — foreign fourcc or size, two
objects, a missing fd, a tiled modifier, zero layers, swapped luma/chroma
layers, a pitch that is not the CAPTURE pitch, chroma at the wrong offset,
luma not at offset 0, an object smaller than its planes, an allocation
smaller than the descriptor claims, a tiled PRIME_1 table, two PRIME_1
buffers. It also pins the one definition of the layout: `plane_layout()`
and `stable_layout()` agree on stride and chroma offset at 1280x720,
1920x1080 and 3840x2176, and the stable size is the plane bytes rounded to
4 KiB.

`test/iris-va-import-probe.cc` is the target half. It is a plain libva
client: it allocates the client buffer the way a compositor on this
platform does (MSM GEM, `stable_layout` size) or, with the `heap`
argument, the way a client that sizes its own allocation does (system
heap, exactly the plane bytes, no 4 KiB rounding). Both runs, 1280x720
NV12:

```
PASS DRM_PRIME_2 import in the CAPTURE layout creates a surface
PASS driver-allocated surface creates
PASS the imported surface is a view of the client's bytes
PASS H.264 encode config creates
PASS encoding the imported surface gives the same bitstream
PASS changed client bytes change the bitstream by the same amount
payload normal=681554 import=681554 changed=687376 changed_import=687376
PASS a client pitch the firmware does not write is refused
PASS PRIME_1 import in the CAPTURE layout creates a surface
```

What each check establishes:

- **View, not copy.** Bytes written through the client's fd (bracketed with
  `DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC`, chroma at the CAPTURE chroma offset) are what
  `vaDeriveImage` + `vaMapBuffer` returns, without any upload call.
- **The firmware reads the client's memory.** One intra-only CQP picture
  (QP 26, `intra_period = 0`) is encoded from the imported surface and from
  a driver-allocated one through a fresh context each, so both are the
  first picture of their session and no rate-control or `frame_num` state
  can differ. The two bitstreams are byte-identical (681,554 bytes). After
  changing the pixels on both sides the two bitstreams are again identical
  to each other (687,376 bytes) and different from the first pair.
- **Refusal happens at creation.** A descriptor whose luma pitch is twice
  the CAPTURE pitch returns `VA_STATUS_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`; libva
  prints the driver's message.

The first measurement of this probe compared encodes inside one session and
was wrong for a mundane reason worth recording: the second picture was a P
frame predicting from the first, so a 554 KB IDR was followed by a 1.7 KB
P frame and the comparison "different" measured GOP position, not memory.

Regression on the same build: 120 frames each of
`sintel-1080p30-h264-b3.mp4` and `sintel-1080p30-hevc-b3.mp4` decode
through `-hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_output_format vaapi` with no error, the
H.264 trace ends `session finish submitted=132 completed=132 errors=0
drops=0 timeouts=0 drains=1 misplaced=0`, a 30-frame `h264_vaapi` encode
produces a 30-frame stream, and `iris-encode-control-probe` on
`/dev/video1` reports the same six absent controls and `0x14` for the
three non-default deblocking requests as the previous record.

`meson test` is 17/17 ( `prime-import` added to the CI inventory) and
`sh test/run-static-checks.sh` passes.

name: `/dev/video0` (`Iris Decoder`), `/dev/video1` (`Iris Encoder`).

The encoder wedged at the first GOP-boundary IDR on every stream whose
rate was not 30 or 31 fps. `h264_vaapi` at 24 fps with `-g 60` stopped
after picture 61 with `endPicture: encoder produced no access unit`; at
24 fps with `-g 30`, after 31; at 24 fps with `-g 120`, after 121; 15, 25,
29, 48 and 60 fps failed the same way, while 30 and 31 fps ran to 300
frames. Size (640x360 too), codec (HEVC too) and rate control (CQP too)
made no difference, and the failure reproduced on the committed baseline
`2f99c2a1`.

Cause, from the frame trace: FFmpeg sends `VAEncMiscParameterFrameRate`
only with IDR pictures — its global parameters go out with IDR
(`vaapi_encode.c`, `base_pic->type == FF_HW_PICTURE_TYPE_IDR`). The driver
derived each picture's timestamp from that picture's own rate, so the
sequence read `… 333333, 458333 (IDR), 400000 …` at 24 fps: forward on
the IDR, backwards on the picture after it. The firmware stops returning
access units once a timestamp goes backwards. A fixed 30 fps fallback
applied to every non-IDR picture is what made exactly 30/31 fps and the
intra-only (`-g 0`, `intra_period = 0`) case pass. Two levers ruled out
the alternatives on the target: skipping `S_PARM` changed nothing, and any
strictly rising timestamp sequence passed even with a 1 ms step.

The session now fixes its rate at `configure()` (also the only point
`S_PARM` can change) and advances one frame duration per picture.

| Rate | GOP | Frames | IDRs | Encode | Decode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 24 | 60 | 300 | 5 | ok | ok |
| 24 | 30 | 120 | 4 | ok | ok |

| 30 | 60 | 300 | 5 | ok | ok |
| 60 | 60 | 240 | 4 | ok | ok |

1920x1080 `testsrc2`, `-b:v 4M`, Annex-B, 12,448,657 bytes for the
24 fps/300-frame case; every stream decodes with `ffmpeg -i … -f null -`
and no error. Iris IRQ delta over the five runs: 2266. Earlier on the
same tree: `sintel-1080p30-h264-b3.mp4` at 24 fps (~720 frames) encoded
whole, and 24 fps HEVC and 24 fps CBR also ran to completion.

`test/unit/encode-session-test.cc` submits FFmpeg's pattern — rate on
picture 0 and on the IDR, nothing in between — and requires strictly
rising timestamps; the old formula fails it (`FAIL: timestamps rise across
an IDR that carries the frame rate`). `meson test` is 17/17 and
`sh test/run-static-checks.sh` passes.

| `eq(n,60)` (the firmware's own boundary) | 0, 60, 120 | 130 | ok |

Iris IRQ delta over the five runs: 1687. Every stream decodes without
error.

Three variants were measured and two of them are wrong, which is why the
session looks the way it does:

- **Restoring the period after the picture completes** puts the following
  picture at the head of a fresh GOP, so `eq(n,24)` produced `0 24 25`
  instead of `0 24`. The period has to be back before the picture is
  queued.
- **Skipping the lever at positions the firmware would make IDRs itself**
  (first picture, GOP boundary) made the driver's idea of the schedule
  drift from the firmware's: with a one-second request the stream came out
  `0 24 48 72 96 144 168 …`, and the requests at 120 and 240 became
  ordinary pictures — silently dropped keyframes, which is worse than an
  extra control write.
- **Never restoring the period** makes every following picture an IDR
  (`0 24 25 26 … 299`).
- Levering on *every* requested picture, including at the firmware's own
  boundary, never drops one. The boundary case produces `0 60 120`: a
  requested IDR there is already an IDR, so the request is satisfied, and
  the next automatic boundary moves accordingly.

The schedule therefore re-anchors on each requested IDR, the way x264 and
libx265 do. `test/unit/encode-session-test.cc` pins the lever, the
restore-before-queue ordering and the intra-only case; removing either
rule fails it (`FAIL: the period is restored before the picture is
queued`, `FAIL: a request at the firmware's own GOP boundary writes no
lever`). `meson test` is 17/17 and `sh test/run-static-checks.sh` passes.

## Segments cut at a requested IDR (2026-10-22)

24 fps, `-g 60 -force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*1)`, `-f segment
-segment_time 1 -segment_format mpegts`.

H.264 and HEVC both write 240 frames as 10 one-second segments; every
segment starts on a keyframe and decodes with `ffmpeg -i … -f null -` and
no error. Iris IRQ delta over both runs: 1633. The same build decodes 120
frames each of `sintel-1080p30-h264-b3.mp4` and
`sintel-1080p30-hevc-b3.mp4` through the VA path with no error.

The first attempt at this produced six of ten H.264 segments and nine of
ten HEVC segments that failed to decode, for two separate reasons:

- **The levered IDR carried no SPS/PPS.** The firmware prefixes the
  parameter sets to its own sync frames only, so a stream cut at a
  requested IDR began with an IDR slice referencing sets the segment did
  not contain (`non-existing PPS 0 referenced`). The session now keeps the
  sets the last access unit carried and prefixes a requested IDR that has
  none, which is what FFmpeg does with extradata before a keyframe.
- **HEVC sets were classified with H.264 rules.** Types 32-34 were not
  recognised as parameter sets at all, so HEVC segments still began with
  `PPS id out of range`. `test/annexb-test.cc` covers both codecs now; it
  also caught the type constants being declared `bool`, which made every
  non-zero NAL type compare equal to SPS.

`meson test` is 18/18 (`annexb` added to the CI inventory) and
`sh test/run-static-checks.sh` passes.

## Requested-IDR edge cases (2026-10-22)

Source `7205500`, same driver SHA-256 as the segment record
(`d11df803…`, `source_dirty=false`), same boot and kernel, 1280x720 at
24 fps.

| Request | Codec | IDR positions | Frames | Decode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `eq(n,0)` | H.264 | 0 | 40 | ok |
| `expr:1` (every picture) | H.264 | 0 … 59, all of them | 60 | ok |
| `eq(n,59)` (the last picture) | H.264 | 0, 59 | 60 | ok |
| `eq(n,24)` | HEVC | 0, 24 | 70 | ok |
| `gte(t,n_forced*1)` | HEVC | 0, 24, 48, … 192 | 200 | ok |

The nine one-second HEVC segments from the last row all start on a
keyframe. Requesting every picture is not the failure mode the "never
skip the lever" rule was worried about: it is the intended cost of a
request per picture, and it produces an all-intra stream.

  exact per-frame MD5 against the native V4L2 decoders, `submitted=48
  capture=48 drops=0 timeouts=0 drain=1`. AV1 skips for the documented
  OBU contract; MPEG-2/VP8 are not on this node.
- `test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh --driver build/src/v4l2_drv_video.so`,
  20 s of `sintel-1080p30-h264-b3.mp4`: `decoder=VaapiVideoDecoder

  passes, on the installed package `df16127ccecf`; that one is the
  package's own record, not this tree's.

The same request pattern ran ten more times in one session (five H.264,
five HEVC, 120 frames each): every run exited 0, decoded cleanly and
carried the same five IDRs, so the lever's per-picture control write does
not drift the firmware's schedule across sessions.

### What changed since the 2026-09-22 verdict

Three behaviors, all in the driver:

- **The one-picture hold is explicit, not a failure.** VA's AV1 picture
  buffer carries no `refresh_frame_flags`; the slots a picture refreshes are
  only visible in the *next* picture's `ref_frame_map`. A shown key frame or
  switch frame refreshes all eight by definition
  (`av1_refreshes_all_slots`), so its bits are known at once; any other
  picture is translated with the next AU and its `vaEndPicture` returns with
  the surface still unsent. `vaSyncSurface`, `vaGetImage`, `vaDeriveImage`
  and `vaExportSurfaceHandle` now wait for that release instead of reading a
  surface with no pixels.
- **Hidden pictures are published, not counted as errors.** The firmware
  returns a `show_frame=0` picture with the ERROR flag, a zero timestamp, no
  KEYFRAME/PFRAME/BFRAME bit and zero bytes used, although it wrote pixels.
  The session attributes such a completion to the oldest pending target
  whose `Target::hidden` is set (decode order) and publishes it; a following
  non-intra picture after an end-of-stream release is refused with
  `VA_STATUS_ERROR_OPERATION_FAILED` rather than decoded against nameless
  slots.
- **End of stream releases the hold.** When the stream ends with a picture
  still held, the sync bound expires, the picture is submitted as final
  (refreshing no slot) and the trace records
  `va sync released the held picture surface=<n>`.

The opt-in switch `V4L2_VA_EXPERIMENTAL_PROFILES` is gone. AV1Profile0 is
advertised whenever the decoder node enumerates AV1 and NV12, the same rule
the capability table now encodes (`production: supported`,
`va_profiles: ["AV1Profile0"]`), and
`test/iris-codec-matrix-check.sh` checks the `profile-qualified-*` block
against the table in both directions.

### Evidence

VAEntrypointVLD`.

| H.264, HEVC, VP9 | unchanged: `submitted=48 capture=48 drops=0 timeouts=0`, content `frame-md5` equal |

Six clips, three runs each, every run's downloaded frames compared with the
software decode of the same clip (`sweep.sh`, both arms `yuv420p`):

| `allintra.mp4` | all-intra | 3/3 |
| `n12.webm` | 12-bit source downconverted, alt-ref | 3/3 |
| `lag720.webm` | 720p, alt-ref | 3/3 |

`hw-av1-nolag.mp4`, 60 frames, with the sync bound cut to 100 ms: `submitted=60
completed=60 errors=0 drops=0 timeouts=0`, downloaded frames bit-exact. A
pipelined client never waits on the hold, so the bound is not part of normal
operation.

`test/av1-obu-roundtrip.sh`, no switch: `PASS rebuilt=18 source=32 all rebuilt
frames bit-exact` against libdav1d.

Chrome 152, `av1-browser.webm`, 25 s windows:

| Run | Decoder | Platform | Frames / dropped | Node holder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 748 / 15 | `--type=gpu-process` |
| 2 | `VaapiVideoDecoder` | true | 747 / 4 | `--type=gpu-process` |

The two drop counts differ on the same clip and build; the second run had
the tablet to itself. Chrome pre-exports its surfaces, and AV1 Import is
refused (the held picture's client buffer cannot be queued in lockstep), so
Chrome publishes through the GPU copy engine.

### Client contract

A client that submits picture N, syncs its surface and only then submits
picture N+1 cannot be served in one round trip: it waits for the sync bound
and gets N released as final. FFmpeg and Chrome both keep at least one AU
in flight, so neither hits it. This is invariant 17 in
`docs/architecture.md`; the failure is a clear `OPERATION_FAILED`, never
pixels from the wrong picture.

## Pipelined encode: `vaSyncBuffer` and `-async_depth` (2026-10-22)

The encoder used to complete one picture inside `vaEndPicture`. FFmpeg turns
on its asynchronous path only when `vaSyncBuffer` exists
(`libavcodec/vaapi_encode.c`, the `VA_STATUS_ERROR_UNIMPLEMENTED` probe with
`VA_INVALID_ID`), so until now `-async_depth` did nothing and a second
picture could not be in flight.

`vaEndPicture` now submits and returns a ticket; the access unit is claimed
by `vaSyncBuffer` on the coded buffer, by `vaSyncSurface` on the input
surface, or by `vaMapBuffer` when the client does neither. The four encoder
input slots are the pipeline depth, and a submit that finds them all in use
completes the oldest picture itself instead of stalling with every CAPTURE
slot unrearmed.

### Build

- Source `8241dbd` plus an uncommitted working tree, tracked-source
  SHA-256 `710d465ed502a1cda9bc4a4acfbd5bc821c72c1945632e6f17f8a7d8631da8f5`
  (the provenance manifest records `dirty=true`, which is accurate here).
- Driver `build/src/v4l2_drv_video.so`, SHA-256
  `fac86f3da4c47881f352e6c981a7e24311f638e166912ec58ccd6dc80282fc36`,
  built from the build tree (`LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`), not the installed
  package. The throughput table below was measured on the immediately
  preceding build (`99c70568…`, identical sources except
  `VAConfigAttribEncMaxRefFrames`); the final build was re-measured at
  depths 1 and 4 and reproduced it (HEVC 3.211 s / 1.617 s, H.264 3.241 s /
  1.657 s) and reproduced the byte-identical sync/async bitstream.
- Kernel `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, `qcom-iris.ko.zst` SHA-256
  `4e29b74df8c9475f1b4ba4de5dc6aa34d90cb224a935459d6b5168c4590c822a`.
- Boot ID `fd1b2389-f4f1-479e-a0aa-58464fc48a80`. Decoder `/dev/video0`,
  encoder `/dev/video1` (both resolved by `iris_driver`).
- FFmpeg 8.1.3.

### Throughput

`testsrc2` 1920x1080 at 30 fps, 600 frames, CBR 12 Mbit/s, `-g 60`, NV12
uploaded from system memory, `ffmpeg -benchmark`, one run each:

| `-async_depth` | HEVC rtime | H.264 rtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 3.159 s (190 fps) | 3.506 s (171 fps) |
| 2 | 1.940 s (309 fps) | 2.101 s (286 fps) |
| 4 | 1.605 s (374 fps) | 1.663 s (361 fps) |
| 6 | 1.645 s (365 fps) | — |
| 8 | 1.631 s (368 fps) | — |
| 16 | 1.667 s (360 fps) | — |
| 32 | 1.673 s (359 fps) | — |

Depth 4 is the knee because that is how many input slots the session
requests; deeper settings pipeline through the same four and gain nothing.
Before this change the depth-4 numbers were what depth 1 measures now.

### Correctness

- `-async_depth 1` and `-async_depth 8` over the same 300 frames at CQP 24,
  `-g 60`, produce byte-identical bitstreams (`051021fa44fc99be…`, `cmp`
  clean). Pipelining changes scheduling, not coding decisions.
- Every depth 4/8/16/32 stream reads back as 1920x1080, 600 frames, and
  decodes with `ffmpeg -f null -` without an error.
- On-demand IDR still cuts where it is asked under pipelining: 24 fps,
  `-g 60 -force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*1) -async_depth 4 -f segment
  -segment_time 1` yields 24 segments, each starting on a key frame.
- The decode matrix is unchanged on the same build: H.264, HEVC, VP9 and AV1
  all `PASS … content=frame-md5` with `timeouts=0 drops=0`, and AV1 still
  reports `submitted=50 capture=50 noshow=23`.

### Acceptance on the final build

Same build (`fac86f3d…`), 1920x1080 `testsrc2`, `-async_depth 4`:

| Case | Result |
| --- | --- |
| H.264 High, 300 frames, CQP 24, `-g 60` | 300 frames, 13122096 bytes, 5 key frames, decodes clean |
| HEVC Main, 300 frames, CQP 24, `-g 60` | 300 frames, 14301743 bytes, 5 key frames, decodes clean |
| HEVC 4K, 120 frames, CBR 20 Mbit/s | 3840x2160, 120 frames, decodes clean |
| H.264 + HEVC in two processes at once | both complete |

The HEVC acceptance run moved the `iris` IRQ line from 37318 to 37924
(delta 606) on `/proc/interrupts` line 229, so the work is on the hardware
encoder and not in a copy path.

### Host tests

`test/encode-session-test` gained two cases: three pictures in flight with
every completion withheld (each ticket claims its own access unit, a later
ticket waits through the middle one, and a zero timeout consumes nothing),
and a picture still outstanding when the context is destroyed, which the
drain resolves for its ticket rather than dropping.

## Encoder `REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME` patch: applies and builds, not loaded (2026-10-22)

The driver side of a direct IDR request is in the same uncommitted tree as
the pipelined encode above: `configure()` writes
`V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_FORCE_KEY_FRAME` once and records whether the node took
it (`encode idr lever=sync-frame|intra-period`), a requested picture then
writes that control and leaves the GOP alone, and a kernel without it keeps
the intra-period lever and the parameter-set prefix from "On-demand IDR by
moving the intra period". `test/encode-session-test` covers both shapes
(`test_on_demand_idr_by_sync_frame` for the direct control,
`test_on_demand_idr` for the GOP lever); `meson test` is 18/18 and
`sh test/run-static-checks.sh` passes.

`packaging/kernel/0003-media-iris-encoder-request-sync-frame.patch` is the
kernel half: the encoder-only rebase of upstream
`6f62dcefd249` (Wangao Wang) onto `sheng-7.2.6` (`42f3b40c702a`). It adds
`REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME` to `enum platform_inst_fw_cap_type`, the
`HFI_SYNC_FRAME_REQUEST_*` enum and `HFI_PROP_REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME
(0x03000145)` to `iris_hfi_gen2_defines.h`, both directions of the
control/capability map in `iris_ctrls.c`, `iris_set_req_sync_frame`, and one
entry at the end of `inst_fw_cap_sm8550_enc` (`CAP_FLAG_INPUT_PORT |
CAP_FLAG_DYNAMIC_ALLOWED`). The upstream commit also adds the control to the
gen1 encoder table and patches `iris_hfi_gen1_command.c`; this branch has no
gen1 encoder on the platform, so neither is carried.

### What was checked, on the builder

A pristine `42f3b40c702a` worktree, `git am` of 0001, 0002 and 0003 in order
applies all three with no fuzz and no rejects. With the three applied, a
module-only build (`make ARCH=arm64 LLVM=1 HOSTCC=gcc HOSTLD=ld
KBUILD_MODPOST_WARN=1 KCFLAGS=-mbranch-protection=pac-ret+bti
M=drivers/media/platform/qcom/iris modules`, clang 21.1.8, the host's
`.config`) links `qcom-iris.ko`, `llvm-nm` lists `iris_set_req_sync_frame`,
and `llvm-readelf -n` reports `aarch64 feature: BTI, PAC`. The module is
2 216 bytes larger than the same tree built without 0003 (7 726 968 vs
7 724 752), which is the control's table entry and setter. Counts on the
patched tree: `cap_id = REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME` 1 in `iris_hfi_gen2.c` and 0
elsewhere, `V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_FORCE_KEY_FRAME` 2 in `iris_ctrls.c` (one
per map direction) and 0 in `iris_venc.c`/`iris_vidc.c`, `cap_id =
DEBLOCK_MODE_H264` still 1.

The control is created from the capability table: `iris_ctrls_init()` walks
`fw_caps[]`, calls `iris_get_v4l2_id()` and `v4l2_ctrl_new_std()`, and
`V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_FORCE_KEY_FRAME` is a button
(`v4l2-ctrls-defs.c`, `V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_BUTTON`, `EXECUTE_ON_WRITE`), so the
core runs `s_ctrl` on every write rather than only on a value change. A
button's value is always 0, so the driver's per-picture `S_CTRL(id, 0)` is
the same write every time.

### What is not evidence

No module was installed and no boot was made: the tablet still runs
`qcom-iris.ko.zst` `4e29b74d…` without this patch, and
`v4l2-ctl -d <encoder> --list-ctrls` there still shows no
`force_key_frame`. So the `sync-frame` path has unit coverage and a compiled
kernel half, not a hardware run. Installing it means replacing the module
and rebooting, which needs the target's owner; until then the driver's
probe finds no control and takes the `intra-period` path, which is the one
the records above measured.

## `REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME` on the target: a direct IDR request (2026-10-22)

The kernel half from the section above was built, installed and booted, and
the driver-side probe now finds the control. This replaces the intra-period
lever on the target: `-force_key_frames` reaches firmware as
`HFI_PROP_REQUEST_SYNC_FRAME` instead of two `GOP_SIZE` writes, and the
driver adds no parameter sets of its own.

### Build and install

- Source `e9a9a2f` (clean tree), tracked-source SHA-256
  `d2efb19f27ce92bbda2c3eedfe57daffc130471670559c5da47ce0ba4c8bf6d0`.
- Driver `build/src/v4l2_drv_video.so`, SHA-256
  `8c2423e7f786a45dc2a10bc8c1c8d1e3bcfa2f610fe0a6cf42dcb87ec4d09823`,
  deployed with `test/remote/deploy.sh` to the build tree
  (`LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`), not the installed package.
- Module built from `42f3b40c702a` + 0001 + 0002 + 0003, target
  `/boot/config-7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40` (`CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=""`,
  `LOCALVERSION_AUTO` off, so `localversion` carries
  `-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`), `Module.symvers` derived from the running
  kernel's `/proc/kallsyms` so `depends:` matches, no `KCFLAGS` override
  because this kernel sets `CONFIG_ARM64_BTI` without
  `CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL`. `vermagic`
  `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`, note
  `aarch64 feature: PAC` (the stock module's note is the same), compressed
  `qcom-iris.ko.zst` SHA-256
  `802c40c0269fe007e0f2d3fb54ad4dfab8d3089d0fd465f3996130f4d2b0a853`.
- Boot ID `8a7cc414-751d-44ec-8e20-fe89dd676ab6` (the stock module's boot
  was `fd1b2389-…`). Decoder `/dev/video1`, encoder `/dev/video2` (resolved
  by `iris_driver`; the numbers moved at this boot).
- `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video2 --list-ctrls` now lists
  `force_key_frame 0x009909e5 (button) : value=0 flags=write-only,
  execute-on-write`; the encoder reports 75 controls. `display_delay` is
  still on the decoder and the six loop-filter controls on the encoder, so
  0001 and 0002 survived the rebuild.

### Lever in force

`V4L2_VA_TRACE=1` on a 20-frame H.264 encode prints
`encode idr lever=sync-frame` before `encode open`, so `configure()`
probed the control and took the direct path.

### Requested IDR positions

1280x720 at 24 fps, `-g 60 -async_depth 4`, 130 frames, CQP 24,
`ffprobe -show_entries frame=key_frame`:

| Request | IDR positions | Frames | Decode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | 0, 60, 120 | 130 | ok |
| `expr:eq(n,24)` | 0, 24, 84 | 130 | ok |
| `expr:eq(n,10)+eq(n,40)` | 0, 10, 40, 100 | 130 | ok |
| `expr:eq(n,60)` (a firmware boundary) | 0, 60, 120 | 130 | ok |

The positions and the re-anchoring match the intra-period record above
exactly, which is the point: the lever changed, the schedule did not.

### What the requested IDR carries

The first access unit of `expr:eq(n,24)` is NAL types 7, 8, 5 (SPS, PPS,
IDR slice): the firmware wrote the parameter sets itself, as it does for
its own sync frames. The first unit of the second H.264 segment (cut at a
requested IDR) is 9, 7, 8, 5 (AUD, SPS, PPS, IDR), and the segment's first
frame is a key frame. The driver's prefix step finds the sets already in
the access unit and adds nothing, so no duplicate SPS/PPS appears.

### Segments

24 fps, `-g 60 -force_key_frames expr:gte(t,n_forced*1) -async_depth 4
-f segment -segment_time 1 -segment_format mpegts`, 240 frames: H.264 and
HEVC each write 10 segments, every one decodes with `ffmpeg -f null -`,
and every one starts on a key frame.

### Pipelining and decode

The same build, 1920x1080 HEVC 600 frames CBR 12 Mbit/s `-g 60`, three
runs each: depth 1 3.597 / 3.631 / 3.134 s, depth 4 1.019 / 1.016 /
1.004 s. The depth-1 and depth-4 bitstreams are byte-identical
(`b437ff325d8f300c0d7373022f03be2a999eae5a4f48a52de4a575caf627e32d`),
read back as 1920x1080 / 600 frames, and decode clean.

The decode matrix on the new module is unchanged: H.264, VP9, HEVC and AV1
all `PASS … content=frame-md5` with `timeouts=0 drops=0` (AV1
`submitted=25 capture=25 noshow=8`).

Iris IRQ delta over the IDR and segment runs: 1829.

### Rollback

`~/Lab/kernel-iris-syncframe/` on the target holds the stock module
(`qcom-iris-stock.ko`, `8e8487ef…`, the decompressed file), the installed
stock `.zst` (`4e29b74d…`), the new module, the target `Module.symvers` and
`stock.sha256`. `rollback.sh` restores the stock `.zst` and re-runs
`depmod`; a reboot is required either way.

## AV1 film grain: refused at the VA layer, before hardware (2026-10-22)

Source `97ebadd` plus the working-tree change that adds the timestamped-error
branch, driver build tree only, kernel `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot ID
`8a7cc414-751d-44ec-8e20-fe89dd676ab6`.

### What was asked

AV1 film grain synthesis is the one decode feature the translator still
refuses. This run establishes where the refusal happens, and whether the
firmware would honour the parameters if it were passed through.

### The stream

`ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2=size=1280x720:rate=30 -frames:v 60 -c:v
libaom-av1 -cpu-used 8 -crf 40 -aom-params film-grain-test=8`, 275 694
bytes, 60 frames. A software decode writes 60 frame MD5s
(`av1-grain-roundtrip/grain-sw.md5`).

### The refusal

`ffmpeg -hwaccel vaapi … -vf hwdownload,format=nv12,format=yuv420p` fails
with `endPicture: film grain parameters are not reconstructed`
(`VA_STATUS_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_BUFFERTYPE`, status 15). The trace shows the
first picture submitted and `va end_picture ctx=6 surface=7 deferred`, then
the second picture rejected at `endPicture`. No Iris session ever sees a
picture with grain parameters, so this is the translator's check in
`src/codec/av1_obu.cc` (`apply_grain`), not a firmware capability result.
The hardware comparison file is empty (0 of 60 frames).

### Why the check is there

The driver rebuilds the AV1 frame header from VA decode parameters rather
than forwarding the client's bitstream. `VAFilmGrainStructAV1` carries the
synthesis parameters, so the header could be rebuilt with them, but the
kernel would not act on them: `FILM_GRAIN` is a `CAP_FLAG_VOLATILE`
capability whose value the kernel takes from the firmware's
`HFI_PROP_AV1_FILM_GRAIN_PRESENT` reply (`iris_hfi_gen2_response.c`) and
sends back at `streamon`. There is no V4L2 control that sets it from
userspace, so the value is whatever the firmware reported — on this node, 0.
Advertising grain support would promise a picture the firmware will not
produce.

### What is not evidence

This run does not show the firmware failing to apply grain, because no
stream with grain ever reached it. A negative firmware result needs the
kernel-side control described in `docs/architecture.md` §1, and that is a
separate change with its own hardware gate.

### Artifacts

`~/Lab/iris-vaapi-lab/artifacts/av1-grain-roundtrip/` on the target:
`source.webm`, `grain-sw.md5` (60 frames), `grain-va.md5` (empty), and
`grain-va.log` with the trace above.

## Corrupt HEVC: the firmware's error buffer names nothing (2026-10-22)

Same build and boot as the film-grain record above. The target runs the
module built from 0001–0003, which does **not** carry the error-timestamp
patch; this run is the evidence for adding it.

### Provoking a corrupt frame

Four attempts on `sintel-1080p30-hevc-b3.mp4` (720 frames, HEVC, 25 184 804
bytes), all decoded with `-hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_output_format vaapi`:

| Damage | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 4 KiB flipped at 60 % of the file | 699/699 frames, `errors=0` |
| 64 KiB zeroed at 60 % | 699/699, `errors=0` |
| 40 slice payloads zeroed | 652/652, `errors=0` |
| 40 slice headers overwritten | 652/652, `errors=0` |
| stream cut mid-NAL at the 100th picture | 178/179, `errors=2` |

The firmware conceals damage inside slice data and reports nothing, so only
the truncation produced an error completion.

### What the driver saw

```
submit token=179 bytes=381 output=0
va destroy_context id=6 pending=2
drain begin reason=finish pending=2
capture token=178 index=13 flags=0x4021 publish=direct
capture error index=4 flags=0x4049
capture empty index=14 flags=0x104001 last=1
drain lost token=179
session finish submitted=179 completed=178 errors=2 drops=0 timeouts=0
```

`0x4049` is ERROR | KEYFRAME | PFRAME: the firmware flagged the picture, but
the kernel zeroed the timestamp (`iris_buffer.c`, the ERROR branch of
`iris_vb2_buffer_done()`), so the completion carried no token. The driver
counted it as a marker and left the target pending; only the drain at end of
stream failed it, as `drain lost`. A client that syncs that surface before
submitting more input waits out the sync bound and gets `TIMEDOUT`, not
`DECODING_ERROR`.

### Fix and its coverage

`packaging/kernel/0004-media-iris-preserve-timestamps-on-error-buffers.patch`
(strongtz, Xilin Wu) copies `buf->timestamp` onto the error completion, and
`Session::handle_capture_returns` now fails the matching target as soon as
the completion is dequeued. `meson test` covers both shapes: a timestamped
corrupt completion fails its surface without a drain, and a timestamped
hidden AV1 picture is still published. On the old driver the first test
reports `wrong status 38 (surface sync timeout)`.

### What is not evidence

The patch has **not been built or loaded on the target**. This record shows
the failure mode it fixes, not the fixed behavior on hardware; that needs a
module rebuild from all four patches and the truncation clip above.

## Error-completion timestamps on the target (2026-10-22)

The record above ("Corrupt HEVC: the firmware's error buffer names nothing")
is the failure it fixes. This run closes it on hardware.

### Build and install

- Source `8dd655e` plus the test fix that follows it, kernel tree
  `42f3b40c702a` with all four patches applied (`git apply`, no fuzz).
- Built on the host against the target's `/boot/config-7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40`,
  `localversion` = `-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, `Module.symvers` derived from
  `/proc/kallsyms`, `HOSTCC=gcc HOSTLD=ld`, no `KCFLAGS`.
- `qcom-iris.ko` 8 896 688 bytes, SHA-256
  `02723c5cd09f948a1f5b7888b3f4f821a06d2d194b49a23419a450f1daea79c3`;
  compressed `qcom-iris.ko.zst` SHA-256
  `9b16a40179a08e414d0f4bb38ea54f5bb12ada2b9ce176f0dc6b3b602e7bc83d`;
  vermagic `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1 SMP preempt mod_unload aarch64`,
  note `aarch64 feature: PAC` (same as the stock module).
- Installed with `~/Lab/kernel-iris-syncframe/install.sh`; the previous
  module (0001–0003, `802c40c0…`) is kept as `qcom-iris.0003.ko.zst`.
- Boot ID `40916c73-1560-484d-bd2e-82fed9bab285`. Decoder `/dev/video0`,
  encoder `/dev/video1` at this boot.
- All four patches are live: the decoder lists two `display_delay`
  controls, the encoder lists the six loop-filter controls and
  `force_key_frame`, and a 20-frame H.264 encode prints
  `encode idr lever=sync-frame`.

### The clip

`trunc.hevc`: `sintel-1080p30-hevc-b3.mp4` converted to Annex-B and cut
mid-NAL at the 100th picture (7 761 287 bytes). `midcorrupt.hevc`: the same
cut followed by the stream resumed at the 13th CRA (17 748 348 bytes), so
valid pictures follow the corrupt one.

### Before and after, same clip

| Driver / module | `trunc.hevc` | `midcorrupt.hevc` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0001–0003 module, driver `97ebadd` | `capture error index=4` (no token), then `drain lost token=179`; the surface waited for the drain | not run |
| four-patch module, driver `8dd655e` | `capture token=179 … flags=0x4049 publish=error`; `errors=1` | `capture token=179 … flags=0x4049 publish=error` at `t=592`, `submit token=180` immediately after, `errors=1`, `completed=495` |

The timestamp the kernel now keeps is what lets the session match the
completion to its target: the failed surface is marked at dequeue instead
of at the end-of-stream drain, and decoding continues with the pictures
after it.

### Regression sweep

- `meson test -C build` on the target: 18/18.
- Decode matrix: H.264, VP9, HEVC and AV1 all `PASS content=frame-md5`,
  `timeouts=0 drops=0`; AV1 `submitted=50 capture=50 noshow=23`, which is
  the hidden-picture path the new branch restructures.
- The mid-stream run above submits and completes 495 of 496 pictures.

### A test bug found on the way

`test/encode-params-test.cc` passed `h264_sequence()` as a temporary into
`h264_input()`, which stores a pointer. The host happened to read zeros
from the dead object; the tablet read `bit_depth_luma_minus8 = 2` left by
the previous case and aborted on "10-bit encode is not supported". The
sequence and picture buffers are now locals in every affected case.

### Rollback

`rollback.sh` restores the stock module; `cp qcom-iris.0003.ko.zst` over
the installed file restores the previous patched module. Both need a reboot.

## Against libva-v4l2 (Radxa), on the same tablet (2026-10-22)

libva-v4l2 (`radxa-pkg/libva-v4l2` 1.0.0, the Radxa sibling backend) publishes
throughput for SC8280XP on a Radxa Dragon Q8B. Those numbers cannot be
read against this tablet's: a different SoC, a different Iris generation
and a different firmware build. The comparison below runs both drivers
on sheng instead, in the same boot, through the same FFmpeg.

### Setup

- Source `972e285` (`feat/encode-entrypoints`), driver
  `build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
  `f3b37e6ad91b76b5ba1b9ec20af055f9494594fec4207a6638313558a3239f24`,
  built on the target with `buildtype=debugoptimized`.
- libva-v4l2 at tag `v1.0.0` (`0e4ce1e`), built on the target with
  `buildtype=release` and its default `-Dfastcv=disabled`; SHA-256
  `798cfd62a91c51be733aa8f28b98b1289a30dd7b0cca4d1c84cda7b6efac7937`.
  Its own release packages disable FastCV the same way, and sheng's CDSP
  cannot open a FastRPC session, so neither side has the VPP.
- FFmpeg 8.1.3, libva 2.23.0, kernel `7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot
  `40916c73-1560-484d-bd2e-82fed9bab285`. Decoder `/dev/video0`, encoder
  `/dev/video1`, both resolved by the `iris_driver` name.
- Each driver was selected with `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=v4l2` and its own
  `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`; neither was installed. Three runs per cell, mean
  reported, in both the decode and the encode tables. Every row moved
  the Iris IRQ counter (583 to 1807 per run), so none of them fell back
  to software.
- Decode clips: `testsrc2` at 720p, 1080p and 4K, 600 or 300 frames,
  H.264 from `libx264 -preset ultrafast -qp 20 -bf 0` and HEVC from
  `libx265 -preset ultrafast -crf 22 keyint=60`, plus VP9
  (`libvpx-vp9`) and AV1 (`libsvtav1`) at 1080p. The real-content rows
  are the tracked Sintel re-encodes already listed above.

### Decode, synthetic clips (frames/s, no download)

| Clip | This driver | libva-v4l2 | libva-v4l2 vs this |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| H.264 720p | 907 | 836 | -8% |
| H.264 1080p | 760 | 681 | -10% |
| HEVC 720p | 720 | 686 | -5% |
| HEVC 1080p | 523 | 464 | -11% |
| H.264 4K | 339 | 221 | -35% |
| HEVC 4K | 201 | 120 | -40% |
| VP9 1080p | 571 | 524 | -8% |
| AV1 1080p | 692 | fails | — |

The gap widens with frame size and has this driver ahead on both codecs,
which is the opposite of what the HEVC slice rewrite would predict: both
drivers re-emit HEVC slice headers there, and neither rewrites H.264
slices (both copy them verbatim). The cause was not isolated. What the
table supports is narrower than a mechanism: on this firmware this
driver keeps more of a 4K stream's time off the CPU than libva-v4l2 does, and
the difference shrinks to single digits at 1080p and below. The 4K HEVC
runs are the noisiest cell (libva-v4l2 2.03 to 2.78 s, this driver 1.45 to
1.59 s); even libva-v4l2's fastest run is slower than this driver's slowest.

libva-v4l2 advertises no AV1 profile, so `-hwaccel vaapi` on the AV1 clip
fails at `av1 @ … Failed setup for format vaapi` before a single picture
is submitted (exit 69, IRQ delta 0).

### Decode, real content with B-frames (frames/s)

| Clip | This driver | libva-v4l2 | libva-v4l2 vs this |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| H.264 High, 2 B-frames, 1080p24 | 311 | 311 | -0.0% |
| HEVC Main, 2 B-frames, 1080p24 | 492 | 493 | -0.2% |
| HEVC Main10, 1080p | 457 | 455 | +0.5% |
| VP9 alt-ref, 1080p | 150 | 150 | +0.2% |

On reordered, 10-bit and alt-ref content the two drivers are the same
within run-to-run noise: what is left is firmware time, and neither
driver's bookkeeping shows through. The synthetic-clip gap is therefore
a cost on the path this driver takes and libva-v4l2 does not, not a general
decode difference.

Frame exactness was checked for the 1080p H.264 and HEVC clips by
comparing a `framemd5` of `hwdownload,format=nv12` against the software
decode. Both drivers MATCH on both codecs.

### Encode, at settings that produce the same bitstream

CQP removes rate control from the picture, so the two drivers can be
compared on output rather than on a rate target they may pursue
differently. At `-rc_mode CQP -q:v 24` and `-q:v 30`, 1080p, 300
frames, the H.264 streams are **byte for byte identical** between the
two drivers, and so is the `-q:v 24` HEVC stream and the same setting on
the Sintel clip. Both sides therefore reach the firmware through the
same encode contract; whatever differs below is not the coded core.

Throughput at that setting, 300 frames, `-async_depth 1` and `4`, three
runs per cell, mean:

| Clip | This driver d=1 | libva-v4l2 d=1 | This driver d=4 | libva-v4l2 d=4 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| H.264 1080p | 235 fps | 196 fps | 439 fps | 424 fps |
| HEVC 1080p | 249 fps | 208 fps | 453 fps | 423 fps |
| H.264 4K | 85 fps | 74 fps | 116 fps | 110 fps |
| HEVC 4K | 99 fps | 83 fps | 121 fps | 119 fps |

This driver is ahead in every cell: 13 to 17% at depth 1, and 2 to 7% at
depth 4, where the two converge because the firmware, not the driver, is
the constraint. A single earlier run had libva-v4l2 10% ahead at depth 4 on
1080p; the three-run repeats above do not reproduce it (libva-v4l2 0.65 to
0.80 s against this driver's 0.53 to 0.78 s), so that reading was
noise. Both drivers scale the same way, and this driver's own pipelining
record (depth 1 to 4, 190 to 374 fps, byte-identical output) is above.

### Encode, rate control: an open difference

At a rate target the two drivers do not agree, and the gap is on
libva-v4l2's side of the comparison:

| Request | This driver | libva-v4l2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| CQP `-q:v 24` | 3045 kbit/s | 3045 kbit/s (identical bytes) |
| CBR 4 Mbit/s | 4034 kbit/s | 741 kbit/s |
| CBR 24 Mbit/s | 21274 kbit/s | 880 kbit/s |
| VBR 4 Mbit/s | 9780 kbit/s | 808 kbit/s |

600 frames of `sintel-1080p30-h264-b3.mp4` at 30 fps; the kbit/s figure
is bytes x 8 / 20 s. This driver tracks the request; libva-v4l2 does not move
with it. The same 4 Mbit/s request on `testsrc2` gives 4034 against
1854195 bytes over 20 s, i.e. the same shape.

What was ruled out on libva-v4l2, each by rebuilding it and re-measuring:

- **Its own values.** With `IRIS_VAAPI_DEBUG=1` it reports
  `bitrate=4000000 peak=4000000 mode=2 (CBR)`, so the client's request
  reaches it intact.
- **The GOP control.** It writes `GOP_SIZE = INT_MAX` and requests
  keyframes through VA instead. Replacing that with 59 left the output
  at 741 kbit/s.
- **The frame rate.** It derives the rate from VA's sequence parameters
  (24/1 for this clip) rather than from the stream rate. Re-encoding the
  source at 30 fps and feeding that changed it to 669 kbit/s, not to
  4000.
- **The header mode.** Adding `HEADER_MODE = JOINED_WITH_1ST_FRAME` to
  this driver left this driver's output unchanged at 4034.
- **QP bounds.** Pinning 1..51, and passing `-qmin/-qmax` through
  FFmpeg, left both drivers unchanged.
- **The control list.** A scratch copy of this driver with libva-v4l2's exact
  control list (GOP `INT_MAX`, header mode, min/max QP) still produced
  4039 kbit/s.

So the difference is not in the control writes either driver makes, and
the root cause was not isolated. It is recorded as an open item rather
than attributed. The observation that stands: on this target, at these
settings, this driver's rate control follows the client's request and
libva-v4l2's does not. One shape is worth checking first in any follow-up:
libva-v4l2's output at every target lands near 700 to 900 kbit/s, which is
close to what a fixed QP near its default 20 would give on this content,
so a firmware that ignores its rate-control property while honouring
explicit QP would look exactly like this. That is a hypothesis, not a
finding; it was not tested.

### What this comparison does not show

- It does not reproduce libva-v4l2's published SC8280XP numbers, and does not
  claim to: the SoC, the Iris generation and the firmware differ.
- It says nothing about Chrome, mpv, VLC or GStreamer. Those runs are in
  the client-coverage section above and have no libva-v4l2 counterpart here.
- The `-Dfastcv=disabled` build is libva-v4l2's own default and the only one
  obtainable on this tablet, but it is not the configuration its README
  describes when it lists FastCV VPP as a feature.
- Three runs per cell throughout. The encode cells at depth 4 still
  spread by up to 0.25 s run to run, so the 2 to 7% advantage there is
  the shape of the result, not a precise figure; the rate-control gap
  (5x) and the depth-1 encode gap (13 to 17%) are far outside that
  spread.
- The VP9 and AV1 rows are one clip each at one resolution. The VP9 row
  shows the two drivers agree where both decode; the AV1 row shows only
  that libva-v4l2 has no AV1 entrypoint on this node, not how an AV1
  implementation of its own would compare.

## AV1 Profile 0 at 10-bit, and the browser matrix beside libva-v4l2 (2026-10-22)

Source `72873c8` plus the working-tree change that adds
`p010_decode_profile()`, driver build tree only
(`build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so`, sha256
`00e60b69eafa2e80…` after the change, `f3b37e6ad91b…` before it), kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot ID
`40916c73-1560-484d-bd2e-82fed9bab285`, decoder `/dev/video0`, encoder
`/dev/video1`. Chrome 152.0.7977.82. Neither driver is installed; each row
selects its bytes with `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`.

### Why AV1 10-bit was missing

The capability table said "10-bit and 12-bit (only AV1Profile0 is
advertised)". That was not a hardware limit. The firmware decodes 10-bit
AV1 on its own: a GStreamer `v4l2av1dec` run of the same clip negotiated
`P010_10LE` and wrote 23 frames of 640x360 P010, with no `unsupported
content` in dmesg. The kernel's 8-bit subscribe-params check
(`iris_hfi_gen2_response.c`, `sub_depth != BIT_DEPTH_8`) does not fire,
because `iris_hfi_gen2_set_bit_depth()` always sends `BIT_DEPTH_8` and the
firmware derives the depth from the stream.

The driver was the blocker, twice over:

- `getConfigAttributes` offered `VA_RT_FORMAT_YUV420_10` only for
  `HEVCMain10` and `VP9Profile2`. A client asks for 10-bit AV1 surfaces
  through that attribute, so no client could create them.
- `querySurfaceAttributes` listed `P010` under the same two profiles only.
  FFmpeg picks its surface format from that list and logged
  `Picked nv12 as best match for yuv420p10le`.

With either one missing the failure is the same and looks like a firmware
fault: `capture format rejected wanted=NV12 granted=P010`, then
`decoder CAPTURE layout unsupported` at `endPicture`. The firmware had
already chosen P010 from the bitstream and refuses NV12 afterwards, so
the session cannot recover — the depth has to be right before the first
access unit.

### The change

One predicate, `p010_decode_profile()`, now answers "does this profile
decode into P010" for the config attributes, the surface attributes and
the capability table. `AV1Profile0` is in it. `test/iris-codec-matrix-check.sh`
asserts that the table's `capture_formats` and that predicate agree in
both directions, so the next profile cannot drift from the document.

### Frame MD5, 10-bit AV1

`av1-640x360-10bit.mp4` (libsvtav1, 30 frames, `profile=Main`,
`pix_fmt=yuv420p10le`), `hwdownload,format=p010le` against libdav1d:

| Path | Frames | MD5 equal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| This driver, VA-API, P010 | 30 | 30/30 |

### Browser acceptance, this driver versus libva-v4l2

Same harness (`test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh`), same clips, 20 s window,
build-tree driver on both sides. libva-v4l2 is the Radxa backend, 1.0.0
built on the target (`/tmp/piano-bench/build`, sha256 `798cfd62a91c…`; the
scratch directory keeps the name the run used).

| Clip | This driver | libva-v4l2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 High 1080p, B-frames | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform, 482 frames, 0 dropped | same, 481 frames, 0 dropped |
| HEVC Main 1080p | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform, 483 frames, 0 dropped | same, 482 frames, 0 dropped |
| HEVC Main10 1080p | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform, 482 frames, 0 dropped | video element error 4, no decoder, node never opened |
| VP9 Profile 0 1080p | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform, 483 frames, 0 dropped | same, 482 frames, 0 dropped |
| AV1 Main 1080p | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform, 599 frames, 0 dropped | `Dav1dVideoDecoder`, not platform, node never opened |
| AV1 Main 10-bit 640x360 | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform, 593 frames, 0 dropped | `Dav1dVideoDecoder`, not platform, node never opened |

Every row that passed also shows a Chrome GPU process holding the resolved
Iris node (`--type=gpu-process` in `iris-node-holders.txt`), and a boot ID
unchanged across the run. The AV1 rows on libva-v4l2 fall back to software
because libva-v4l2's `vainfo` lists no `VAProfileAV1Profile0`; the HEVC Main10
row is a harder failure, the element itself errors and nothing is decoded.
Both were re-run once to confirm.

### What this does not show

The 10-bit AV1 clip is 640x360 and 30 frames. It proves the depth
plumbing, not throughput; a 1080p 10-bit AV1 run is not in this record.
Chrome's P010 surfaces were confirmed from the driver trace
(`fourcc=P010` for every `va create_surfaces` on that row), not from a
pixel comparison against software output, which Chrome does not expose.

### Film grain stays refused, and it is a kernel limit

A 1280x720 60-frame AV1 stream encoded with `-aom-params film-grain-test=8`
is still rejected at `endPicture` (`film grain parameters are not
reconstructed`). The refusal is correct: `FILM_GRAIN` is a
`CAP_FLAG_VOLATILE` capability, its value comes from the firmware's
`HFI_PROP_AV1_FILM_GRAIN_PRESENT` reply, and `v4l2-ctl -l` on the decoder
lists no film-grain control at all — nothing in the V4L2 surface lets
userspace turn it on. Passing the parameters through would advertise a
picture the firmware will not produce. The firmware-path probe agrees in
the weakest possible way: GStreamer's `v4l2av1dec` on the same stream
wrote 44 frames out of 60 and no dmesg line, so the firmware drops
pictures on that stream rather than synthesising grain.

### Artifacts

On the target: `~/iris-vaapi-lab/artifacts/browser-acceptance/` (one
directory per row above, each with `summary.json`, `cdp.json`,
`browser.log` and `iris-node-holders.txt`),
`/tmp/iris-bench/lab*/artifacts/browser-acceptance/` for the rows that
were run under a scratch lab root, `/tmp/iris-bench/av110-va.md5` and
`av110-sw.md5` for the frame MD5s, and
`~/iris-vaapi-lab/media/10bit/av1-640x360-10bit.mp4` for the clip.

## VP9 conformance through the driver, first full suite (2026-10-22)

Same build and boot as the section above. `FFmpeg-VP9-VAAPI` over the whole
`VP9-TEST-VECTORS` corpus, one vector at a time, 20 s per vector:

| Total | Passed | Fail | Crash | Timeout |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 305 | 175 | 36 | 67 | 27 |

Every non-pass falls into one of five families, and the driver trace
explains three of them:

- **64 × `vp90-2-02` tiny dimensions, below the advertised 96x96.** FFmpeg
  refuses before any VA call: `Hardware does not support image size 8x8
  (constraints: width 96-8192 height 96-8192)`. The bounds come from the
  kernel's CAPTURE enumeration, so these vectors cannot reach this driver on
  this SoC. Checked on 08x08 and 66x66.
- **36 × `vp90-2-14` dynamic resize with frame-parallel tiles, content
  mismatch.** The frames decode (the trace shows two sessions, 432x240 then
  896x480, and every submitted picture completes) but the MD5s differ from
  `libvpx-vp9`. Not classified further here.
- **24 × `vp90-2-21` timeouts** at the 20 s bound, and **3 more** in the
  `05`/`18`/`22` vectors.
- **`vp90-2-10-show-existing-frame`** and **`vp90-2-16-intra-only`** crash;
  the first is the case the translator refuses by design
  (`show_existing_frame` must reuse the VA surface).
- **`vp91-2-04-yuv444`** crashes; 4:4:4 is outside the advertised profiles.

This is a driver-path number, not comparable one-for-one with the
firmware-path `GStreamer-*-V4L2` table above (235/305): the Fluster FFmpeg
wrapper decodes through a different client stack. It is the first full run
of this suite through the driver and replaces the three-vector probe that
was recorded earlier.

Artifact: `/tmp/iris-bench/vp9-va.md` on the target (per-vector marks), plus
`vp9res-va.md5` / `vp9res-sw.md5` for the resize vector above.

## Chrome's decode path, measured inside the browser (2026-10-23)

The Import policy was qualified with a probe and the browser runs counted
frames; neither said which publish policy a browser decode actually took.
This run answers that from the driver's own trace. Source commit `821c9f2`,
build `build-def`, driver sha256 `33fff189…`, kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot `90008d1c-4049…` (the target rebooted
since the previous section), Chrome 152.0.7977.82, 20 s window per clip,
`IRIS_ACCEPTANCE_ENV="V4L2_VA_TRACE=1"`.

| Clip | Per-capture policy | Frames | Dropped |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| H.264 High 1080p, B=3 | `publish=import` ×678 | 481 | 0 |
| HEVC Main 1080p | `publish=import` ×676 | 481 | 2 |
| HEVC Main10 1080p | `publish=import` ×678 | 480 | 0 |
| VP9 P0 1080p | `publish=copy-gpu` ×671 | 481 | 0 |
| AV1 Main 1080p | `publish=copy-gpu` ×853, `publish=drop` ×13 | 593 | 0 |

What this settles:

- **Chrome does not import its own buffers.** Every surface is created with
  `imported=0 fd=-1` (22 of them), and the driver exports each stable buffer
  once (`persistent=1`) for `vaExportSurfaceHandle`. The import decision is
  therefore made by this driver about its own memory, not by a client
  handing over a DMA-BUF. That is the same arrangement §3.3 describes as
  Chrome pre-exporting its pool, now confirmed from the browser rather than
  from the FFmpeg path.
- **H.264, HEVC and HEVC 10-bit are zero-copy in Chrome.** Every capture is
  attributed to an imported buffer, the CAPTURE queue carries a DMABUF fd
  (`import token=1 index=0 fd=94 …`), and no copy operation appears in the
  trace.
- **VP9 and AV1 are not**, exactly as the capability table says: VP9 by the
  alt-ref 1:2 rule, AV1 by the hidden-picture rule.
- The 13 AV1 drops are the hidden pictures, one per alt-ref interval
  (tokens 61, 123, 185, 247, flags `0x4011`), not errors. The session
  attributes them by decode order and publishes no pixels for them.

One number is not clean: the HEVC 8-bit window dropped 2 frames where the
same clip measured 0 earlier. The build and the boot both changed, so this
is recorded as observed rather than attributed.

Artifacts: `/tmp/iris-bench/lab-import/{h264,sintel-1080p30-hevc-b3,
sintel-1080p30-hevc10,sintel-1080p30-vp9,hw-av1}/` on the target
(`browser.log`, `cdp.json`, `summary.json`).

## Browser playback on real sites, and an alt-ref regression it caught (2026-10-23)

The install gate ran with the build-tree driver only; the browser matrix after
the install covered local clips. This run adds the missing client: plain
`google-chrome` (no environment, resolving the driver through the
`msm_drv_video.so` alias) playing YouTube and Bilibili, with the driver trace
on.

### Install

`install-system.sh build-def` over the 2026-09-22 package (`1d15de2`,
`df16127c…`). Manifest: source `166eb01`, artifact `33fff189…`, the previous
driver kept at `/usr/local/share/iris-vaapi/backup/`. `vainfo` with no
environment lists `VAProfileAV1Profile0` through the alias. Kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1` with all four patches, boot
`90008d1c-4049…`.

| Site | Codec, size | Decoder | Frames / dropped | Per-frame policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YouTube `aqz-KE-bpKQ` | AV1 854x480 | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform | 600 / 0 | `copy-gpu` ×806 |
| Bilibili `BV1GJ411x7h7` | HEVC Main 640x360 | `VaapiVideoDecoder`, platform | 500 / 0 | `import` ×832 |

### The VP9 regression

The four-video YouTube sweep hit a VP9 clip (`LXb3EKWsInQ`, adaptive, mostly
854x480) where every session logged dozens of
`capture token=… flags=0x4041 publish=error` lines, each followed by a
same-token `publish=drop`: 50 errors / 50 drops per session, reproduced. The
same clip through the previous install (build `df16127c…`, which predates
`8dd655e`) shows none: 1080 `copy-gpu`, one drop.

The mechanism: a VP9 alt-ref access unit is one VA picture the firmware
decodes as two completions under one token — the invisible frame first
(ERROR, no picture-type bit, no payload), the visible frame immediately
after. `8dd655e` fails a timestamped error completion at once; on the 0004
module the invisible completion carries its timestamp, so every alt-ref
failed its target and the real frame behind it was dropped as unnamed. The
session unit test now scripts this two-completion shape
(`test_vp9_altref_superframe_is_one_picture`), and the fix keeps a
completion that has no picture-type bit and no payload pending until the
next one publishes it. A real corrupt picture carries a picture-type bit
(the truncated HEVC here came back `0x4049`, ERROR|KEYFRAME) and still fails
at once; that shape is asserted by the existing corrupt test, now fed with
`V4L2_BUF_FLAG_KEYFRAME`.

After the fix (`66a6a98`, installed): the same VP9 clip logs
`publish=invisible` ×118 and zero errors; the decode matrix passes
unchanged (VP9 `48/48` frame-MD5). Committed as `97dde61`.

### Where the fix was verified

| Run | Driver | VP9 854x480, `LXb3EKWsInQ` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| before | `build 2b860ea8` (= `821c9f2`) | 26 drops in Chrome, 8 token-less errors |
| before | installed `df16127c…` (pre-`8dd655e`) | 1080 `copy-gpu`, 1 drop, Chrome 600/0 |
| after | installed `66a6a98` | 118 `publish=invisible`, 0 errors, Chrome 995/6 |

### The AV1 observation, still open

One `yt-music` run served an AV1 1280x720 rendition whose session logged 136
`publish=error` completions (`0x4051` PFRAME|ERROR ×129, `0x4049` ×7), in
consecutive-token pairs, while Chrome reported 501 frames / 0 dropped. Three
later runs at 854x480 and 1080p show zero errors, and the pre-fix tree at
854x480 shows the same class as 8 token-less `0x4041` errors. The video
plays; nothing is attributed to the fix. It is recorded as an open
rendition-dependent observation, not a conclusion.

## AV1 loop restoration: the frame header carried the wrong unit (2026-10-23)

The open AV1 observation above had a cause, and it was the driver's OBU
writer, not the firmware or the rendition.

### What the failure looked like

`yt-720.webm` (AV1 1280x720, 5326 frames, 4 tiles, 128x128 superblocks,
loop restoration enabled) through `av1_vaapi` died on its third key frame.
The session logged `capture token=18 flags=0x4049 publish=error` and then a
cascade of `0x4051 publish=error` / `publish=drop`; FFmpeg exited with an
I/O error after 24 of 213 submitted pictures. The same file decoded
correctly with the in-kernel `v4l2av1dec`, so the file and the node were
both fine.

### How it was pinned to one bit

- `V4L2_VA_DUMP` wrote every rebuilt access unit; the failing one (16808
  bytes) failed on its own in both `aomdec` ("Failed to decode tile data")
  and libdav1d, so it did not depend on the frames before it.
- A hybrid stream (rebuilt units up to the key frame, then the source's own
  key frame) decoded; the reverse did not. The defect is inside the
  rebuilt key access unit.
- The four tile payloads were byte-identical to the source
  (`[5224, 4686, 4089, 2766]`), so the tiles and the tile-size prefixes
  were not the problem.
- `ffmpeg -bsf:v trace_headers` on the source and rebuilt key access units
  produced the same fields everywhere except two, both of them expected and
  legal (`use_superres` present because our sequence header enables it,
  `tile_size_bytes_minus_1` = 3 instead of 1). One real difference remained:
  `lr_unit_shift`, source 1, rebuilt 2.
- Clearing that single bit in the dumped access unit made `aomdec` accept
  it.

### The defect

`lr_unit_shift` is coded as `read_increment()`: unary ones from the range
minimum, a zero ends it, and `range_max` ends it without a zero
(`libavcodec/cbs_av1.c`, `cbs_av1_write_increment`; spec 5.9.20). With
64x64 superblocks the range is 0..2; with 128x128 superblocks it is 1..2.
The writer emitted `lr_unit_shift != 0` as one bit in both branches, so
VA's resolved 1 became a coded 2 in 128x128 streams. The decoder then ran
restoration over a 128-pixel unit where the encoder had used 64, and the
tile data it read did not match what it expected.

The 64x64 branch had a second bug of the same kind: it wrote
`lr_unit_shift ? 1 : 0` twice, so 1 and 2 were indistinguishable there too.

### Verification

The first run used the build tree (`build-def`) only; the records below are
from that driver and were then repeated against the installed package (see
"Install" at the end of this section). Source `98167ea`, driver
`build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
`0913ddec2eebe3dd6a0da054e524a225f60dc67ec046454e3ef21abaaaeb0ded`, kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot
`90670102-4d45-4b5b-935d-a3dbe97de028`. Node resolved by the `iris_driver`
QUERYCAP name: `/dev/video17` (`Iris Decoder`), encoder `/dev/video18`.
Everything below ran through `-hwaccel vaapi` with `hwdownload,format=nv12`
and was compared frame by frame to a software decode of the same file
(`format=nv12`, so stride cannot account for a difference).

| Clip | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yt-720.webm` AV1 1280x720 | stops at token 18, 24/213 pictures, FFmpeg exit 251 | `submitted=5448 completed=5448 errors=0 drops=0`, 5326/5326 frames MD5-identical |
| `yt-1080.mp4` AV1 1920x1080 | not re-run (same writer path) | `submitted=5471 completed=5471 errors=0 drops=0`, 5326/5326 frames MD5-identical |
| `test/av1-obu-roundtrip.sh` default source | 18/32 bit-exact | 18/32 bit-exact, unchanged |
| `test/av1-obu-roundtrip.sh` on 120 frames of `yt-720.webm` | — | 72 rebuilt / 120 source, all bit-exact |

The last row is the roundtrip test pointed at the real multi-tile stream
(`IRIS_AV1_ROUNDTRIP_SOURCE`), which the 320x180 default source cannot
reach: it uses 64x64 superblocks and has restoration disabled.

`test/av1-obu-test.cc` (new) walks the rebuilt header back in spec order
and fails on three checks if the writer reverts to a boolean coding.

Chrome was re-run on the same clip with the build-tree driver
(`test/iris-browser-acceptance.sh`, `V4L2_VA_TRACE=1`): `VaapiVideoDecoder`,
platform true, 501 frames / 0 dropped, `submitted=716 completed=716
errors=0 drops=0`, all `publish=copy-gpu`, GPU process holding
`/dev/video17`.

### Install and the installed-package recheck

`install-system.sh build-def` over the 2026-09-22 package. Manifest: source
`ab19b8a`, artifact `0913ddec…`, the previous driver kept at
`/usr/local/share/iris-vaapi/backup/`. The installed
`/usr/lib64/dri/v4l2_drv_video.so` is byte-identical to the build-tree one,
and `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME`/`LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH` were unset for the recheck, so
libva resolved the driver through `msm_drv_video.so` the way a client that
knows nothing about this project does.

| Clip, installed driver | Session | Frames |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yt-720.webm` | `submitted=5448 completed=5448 errors=0 drops=0` | 5326/5326 MD5-identical |
| `yt-1080.mp4` | `exit 0` | 5326/5326 MD5-identical |

GStreamer's `vaav1dec` is not evidence for this codec yet: its element syncs
each surface as it goes, which releases the held picture and makes the next
`vaEndPicture` fail with "AV1 stream continued after a picture was released
at download time". The FFmpeg and Chrome paths do not do that. Not a
regression from this change: the same pipeline against the backed-up
previous driver (`66a6a98…`) logs the same 30 refusals, so it is a property
of the held-picture contract and this client, not of the header fix. It
belongs in the record as a client that does not decode AV1 through this
driver.

Artifacts: `~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/iris-bench/av1-720/` on the target
(`hw-all.md5`, `sw-nv12.md5`, `hw1080.md5`, `sw1080.md5`, `rt-real/`,
`browser-av1/`), and
`~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/av1-hdr/` on the builder (the dumped access units, the
`trace_headers` diffs, and the one-bit patch that proved the field).

## AV1 and H.264 resolution change inside one VA context (2026-10-23)

A concatenated stream that switches from 1280x720 to 854x480 mid-file
decoded its first segment and then stalled: every 854x480 access unit was
accepted by the driver, none produced a picture, and the session ended on
`sync timeout token=43 ... action=fail` followed by `session failed: no LAST
after STOP`. The same file decoded fully in the in-kernel `v4l2av1dec`
(GStreamer, 80/80 frames), so the file, the node and the firmware were all
capable of it.

### What the trace showed

`V4L2_VA_TRACE=1` on the failing run:

```
event source-change state=1
session reconfigure 1280x720 ->
drc drain begin pending=2
capture token=43 index=5 flags=0x104041 publish=invisible
drc drain complete last=1
capture configure 896x480 ... visible=854x480
session reconfigure -> 854x480
submit token=44 ...            (six 854x480 access units, all returned clean)
output return index=0 flags=0x4001 token=44
sync timeout token=43 pending=6 queued=32 held=0 action=fail
```

The OUTPUT returns carried no error, so the firmware had consumed the new
segment and chosen not to decode it. Kernel `dynamic_debug` on
`iris_inst_change_state` / `iris_inst_change_sub_state` showed an identical
state machine to GStreamer's on the same file (`0x22` -> `0x66` -> CAPTURE
STREAMOFF -> STREAMON -> `0`), so the DRC steps themselves were right.

### The defect

`configure_capture()` issued `S_FMT(CAPTURE, <GEOMETRY FROM G_FMT>)` on every
bring-up, including the one that follows a mid-stream `SOURCE_CHANGE`.
`iris_vdec_s_fmt` (CAPTURE branch) rewrites `inst->fmt_dst` and `inst->crop`
from that request, replacing the coded size, stride and crop
`iris_hfi_gen2_handle_src_change` had just derived from the bitstream. The
resume then hands the firmware the client's rectangle instead of the
stream's. GStreamer's strace shows the contract: it never calls `S_FMT` on
CAPTURE at all, only `G_FMT` then `REQBUFS`.

The fix reads `G_FMT` and issues `S_FMT` only when the driver's answer is not
the pixel format the client needs (a P010 surface against an NV12 default).

### Why it looked like an AV1 defect

Only the AV1 clip reached it here, and not because AV1 is special: FFmpeg
recreates its VA context at every coded-size change, so a mid-file switch in
most streams never reaches the in-context path at all. H.264 was tried as a
control and turned out not to be one — the H.264 run created two contexts
(`va create_context` ×2, `reconfigures=0`) and therefore tested context
teardown, not this defect. The AV1 run stayed in one context
(`va create_context` ×1), which is why it was the one that stalled. What
separated "AV1 writer" from "session ordering" was the dump: the rebuilt
access units decoded cleanly in software (0 errors), so the bytes were
right and the ordering was not.

### Verification

Source `99dcf30`, driver `build-def/src/v4l2_drv_video.so` SHA-256
`f155e2f51ec28cb70459f3f5460c5cbdd94ed791e60db902de094c916e103566`, kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot
`ebe7a2b2-9ae2-4725-ad33-be856e6ec7a1`. Node resolved by the `iris_driver`
QUERYCAP name: `/dev/video2` (`Iris Decoder`). Everything below used the
build tree (`LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH=build-def/src`) through `-hwaccel vaapi`
with `hwdownload,format=nv12`, compared frame by frame to a software decode
of the same file.

| Run | Before `99dcf30` | After `99dcf30` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resize-av1.mkv` (40x 720p + 40x 854x480, AV1) | 40/80 frames, `submitted=49 completed=42 timeouts=1` then `session failed`; FFmpeg exit 251 | **not fixed.** 1 of 3 runs: 80/80 frames, `submitted=84 completed=84 errors=0 drops=0 timeouts=0 drains=2`, MD5-identical to software. The other 2: the same 40/80 stall and exit 251 |
| `resize-h264.mkv` (same geometry switch, H.264) | exit 0, 80 frames, two contexts | exit 0, 80 frames; not a control for this defect (see above) |
| `test/iris-matrix.sh` (48 frames per codec) | PASS | PASS: h264, vp9, hevc, av1 all `content=frame-md5` |
| `test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh` (6 switches) | PASS | PASS: native baseline, VA single-process and fresh-context runs all frame-exact |

The AV1 run leaves the in-context path visible in its own counters:
`session reconfigure 1280x720 ->` at the boundary and `session reconfigure ->
854x480` when the pool is rebuilt, with both segments decoded by the same VA
context (`contexts=1`).

### Correction (same day): the defect is not fixed, it is probabilistic

The first version of this section claimed the run above proved the fix. It
did not: one hardware run was treated as a result. Eight further runs from
the same committed build and the same driver binary
(`f155e2f5…`, unchanged) split as follows.

| Runs | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 3 of 11 | 80/80 frames, exit 0 |
| 8 of 11 | 40/80 frames, `sync timeout token=43`, `session failed: no LAST after STOP`, exit 251 |

What separates them, from `V4L2_VA_TRACE=1` plus an OUTPUT-dequeue probe
(`PROBE out index=… token=…`) and `dynamic_debug` on `iris_state.c`:

- The kernel sub-state machine is identical in both
  (`0x22` -> `0x66` -> CAPTURE `STREAMOFF` -> `STREAMON` -> `0`), so the DRC
  steps this driver issues are right. GStreamer `v4l2av1dec` on the same
  file, same node, same kernel decodes 80/80 in 5 consecutive runs, and an
  ioctl-level strace of its DRC window shows the same order: no `S_FMT` on
  CAPTURE, `G_FMT` only, drain to the boundary `LAST`, `STREAMOFF`,
  `REQBUFS(0)`, `REQBUFS(5)`, `STREAMON`.
- The boundary access unit (token 43, the first 854x480 key frame) completes
  exactly once, as `flags=0x104041` (`ERROR|LAST`, no picture-type bit, no
  payload). In a run that works the *same* token completes twice: that
  marker first, then `0x4009` (KEYFRAME, real pixels) after the rebuilt pool
  is streaming.
- In the failing runs the OUTPUT slot that carried token 43 returns before
  the resume, and a later access unit takes the same slot; in the working
  runs it stays owned by the firmware until after `STREAMON`. Same binary,
  same file, same node, different interleaving.
- The failing runs also see one extra empty `LAST` (`0x104001`, token 0) on
  the rebuilt pool immediately after `STREAMON`, which sets
  `q->last_buffer_dequeued` in vb2 and turns every later CAPTURE `DQBUF`
  into `EPIPE`. The firmware answered the resume by declaring the queue
  finished.

None of that is addressable from this driver: it consumes the boundary
access unit, it decides whether to decode it a second time, and it decides
whether the resumed CAPTURE queue is finished. Only FFmpeg's own context
recreation path (`contexts=2`, which H.264 already takes and which every
FFmpeg build does at a coded-size change) avoids it entirely.

So the `S_FMT` change stays — it is a contract requirement
(`docs/architecture.md` §4) and without it the working runs would decode the
new segment at a geometry the stream never named — but in-context AV1 DRC
stays **unqualified**. `data/iris-codec-capabilities.json` and
`docs/architecture.md` carry that, and the target-side evidence is
`~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/iris-bench/av1-720/` (`out-a.log` success, `out-b.log`
failure, `gst.strace`, `flag-a.log`, `dd-c.dmesg`).

`Iris Decoder`, `/dev/video3` `iris_driver` / `Iris Encoder`. This is the
installed package, not a `DESTDIR` staging run and not a build-tree
override.

Artifacts on the target: `~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/iris-bench/av1-720/`
(`resize-av1.mkv`, `resize-h264.mkv`, `hw.md5`, `sw.md5`, `hwmd5.log`).

## Correction (2026-10-24): the in-context DRC defect is in this driver

The section above concluded that the intermittent AV1 resolution-change stall
was "not addressable from this driver" because the firmware decides whether
to decode the boundary access unit a second time. That conclusion was wrong.
The empty `LAST` (`0x104001`) on the rebuilt pool is not the firmware
declaring the queue finished — it is the kernel completing a `CAPTURE` `QBUF`
on the client's behalf, and the driver controls when that `QBUF` happens.

`iris_vb2_buf_queue` (`iris_vb2.c:313-328`) has a branch that fires when a
`CAPTURE` buffer arrives while the instance still carries the DRC boundary
sub-state (`IRIS_INST_SUB_DRC | IRIS_INST_SUB_DRC_LAST`): it does not hand
the buffer to the firmware, it completes it on the spot with
`V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`, payload 0, and calls `v4l2_m2m_mark_stopped`. vb2 then
sets `q->last_buffer_dequeued` (`videobuf2-v4l2.c:853-856`), and every later
`DQBUF` returns `-EPIPE` (`videobuf2-core.c:2011`). The kernel clears that
sub-state in exactly one place — `iris_process_streamon_output`
(`iris_common.c:100-155`) — which is the `CAPTURE` `STREAMON` ioctl.

`enter_streaming()` used to call `pool_.requeue_capture()` first and
`device_->stream(Queue::Capture, true)` second, so the 32 pool `QBUF`s
arrived before the sub-state was cleared. Why only two runs in three failed
rather than all of them: the boundary access unit also completes once as
`ERROR|LAST` (`0x104041`), and that completion takes the error path in
`iris_vb2_buffer_done` (`iris_buffer.c:771-778`) which returns before it
reaches the `V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST` test that would set
`inst->last_buffer_dequeued`. The two orders therefore differ only by a few
microseconds of interleaving, which is why `strace` made the run pass (it
slows every ioctl) and why the kernel sub-state log looked identical in both
outcomes (`0x16` -> `0x42` -> `0`).

The fix reverses the two calls: `STREAMON` first, then the pool, for both
Mmap and Import memories. `test/unit/session-test.cc` had asserted the old
order ("the first picture's buffer went in before CAPTURE streamed") and now
pins the new one.

Framemd5 oracle, `resize-av1.mkv` (80 frames, one VA context, one
1280x720 -> 854x480 change), `V4L2_VA_TRACE=1`, build tree
`~/Lab/qualcomm-iris-vaapi/build-def/src`:

| Build | Runs | 80/80 frames, exit 0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| before (`7f5936e`) | 6 | 2 |
| after (`c4e957d`) | 44 | 44 |

The 44 are 6 + 10 + 16 + 12 across four sessions. In a passing run the
boundary token completes as `0x4009` (KEYFRAME, real pixels) after the
rebuilt pool streams, and the extra `0x104001` no longer appears; the single
`0x104001` that remains in a passing log is the terminal EOS drain
(`index=10`).

Regression checks on the same build:

- `test/iris-matrix.sh`: PASS h264, hevc, vp9, av1, all `content=frame-md5`,
  48 frames each, `timeouts=0 drops=0`.
- `test/iris-dynamic-resolution.sh`: PASS h264, `switches=100`,
  `contexts=101`, byte-identical native output and exact MD5 across every
  change.
- `sh test/run-static-checks.sh` PASS; `meson test -C build-def`
  19/19 OK, 0 Fail.

Installed package, no environment overrides (`scripts/install-system.sh
build-def`): `source_commit=ff3269f`, `source_dirty=0`,
`artifact_sha256=ea7030b6…`, installed driver sha256 identical. Eight runs
with `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME`/`LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH` unset through `env -u`: 8 of 8
gave 80/80 frames, exit 0, `token=43` completing as `0x4009` after
`capture configure 896x480`. The only `0x104001` in those logs is the
terminal EOS drain at `index=10`.

Both fixes together, installed as a package: `source_commit=3cfaa7e`,
`source_dirty=0`, `artifact_sha256=cb9053e0…`, installed driver sha256 equal
to the build tree. Direct path (no overrides) 8 of 8 runs give 80/80 frames,
each byte-identical to the software reference; Copy path
(`V4L2_VA_PUBLISH=copy`) 6 of 6, likewise byte-identical. `meson test -C
build-def` 19/19 OK.

The A/B sweep that confirmed the ordering fix also surfaced a second defect on
the Copy publish path, which the default Direct path never reaches. Forcing
`V4L2_VA_PUBLISH=copy` made the same file fail at the first post-change
picture with `gpu copy: invalid buffer layout`. `GpuBlitter::copy` built both
the source and destination views from `to.width`/`to.height`, the destination
surface's layout, while `from` is the new-resolution frame; a client surface
still at the old geometry then asks for a source rectangle the source buffer
never had (`gpu_copy.cc:132`). FFmpeg's download path reuses its surface pool
across a resolution change, so this is reachable, and it is reachable in
production: the capability table marks only H.264 and HEVC Import-qualified,
so a pre-exporting client decoding AV1 publishes through Copy.

`copy_pixels()` already intersects the client's rectangle with the buffer's
for the CPU path; `copy()` now does the same — each view is built from its own
layout, and the copy covers `min(from, to)` in each dimension. Same harness,
`V4L2_VA_PUBLISH=copy`, `resize-av1.mkv`:

| Build | Runs | Frames | Against software |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| before (`ff3269f`) | 3 | 40 of 80, `invalid buffer layout` | n/a |
| after (`378c113`) | 6 | 80 of 80 | byte-identical, every frame |

A file without a resolution change is unaffected: `h720.mkv` gives 40 of 40
frames on both builds, byte-identical to each other. That output differs from
the software decode of the same file, which is a property of the GPU copy's
colour conversion and not of this change; it is the same on both builds.

Artifacts: `~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/iris-bench/av1-720/` — `f-*.log` and `v-*.log`
passing, `n-*.log`/`q-*.log` the before/after pair with the kernel trace,
`cp-*.log` the Copy path after the fix, `pub-copy-*.log` before it.

## Codec conformance: Fluster on the installed package (2026-10-24)

Fluster 0.8.0 (`pip install --user fluster-conformance`), run against the
installed driver with no `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME` or `LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`. Fluster
reports the backend it found on its own:

```
"VA-API": "Qualcomm Iris V4L2 stateful (libva-v4l2) (runtime 1.23)"
"V4L2 M2M": "Iris Decoder (/dev/video2)"
```

The FFmpeg VA-API wrapper inherits the environment, so the numbers below are
this driver's, not the firmware's through a different client. Source commit
`434be71`, driver SHA-256 `f155e2f5…`, kernel
`7.2.6-sm8550-g42f3b40-iris1`, boot `ebe7a2b2-…`.

| Suite | Decoder | Passed | Total | Profile split |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `JVT-AVC_V1` | `FFmpeg-H.264-VAAPI` | 72 | 135 | Constrained Baseline 33/33, Main 39/89, Baseline 0/7, Extended 0/6 |
| `JCT-VC-HEVC_V1` | `FFmpeg-H.265-VAAPI` | 141 | 147 | Main 131/135, Main 10 9/11, Main Still Picture 1/1 |

Neither number is a driver defect count. Every failure was classified by
running each vector directly and reading the kernel's own message
(`~/Lab/Bridge/tmp/fluster/h264-failures.csv`, and the same method for HEVC):

H.264, 63 failures:

| Count | Cause |
| ---: | --- |
| 49 | Kernel refuses the stream: `unsupported content, bit depth: 80008, pic_struct = N`, then `state changed from 2 to 5`. All 49 carry `frame_mbs_only_flag = 0` in their SPS (verified with `-bsf:v trace_headers`): the firmware has no field/MBAFF decoding. The driver surfaces the kernel's refusal as an error, which is correct. |
| 7 | Baseline profile, 6 Extended: neither is advertised in `data/iris-codec-capabilities.json`, so FFmpeg never reaches the hardware path. Expected. |
| 6 | Baseline/Extended vectors whose decoded pixels differ from the reference, on a profile this driver does not advertise. |
| 1 | `FM2_SVA_C` could not be probed (no readable elementary stream in the vector directory). |

The 33/33 Constrained Baseline result and the 39 passing Main vectors are
frame-coded streams, which is the shape the firmware supports.

HEVC, 6 failures:

| Count | Vector | Cause |
| ---: | --- | --- |

| 1 | `VPSSPSPPS_A_MainConcept_1` | The vector switches 352x288 -> 1280x720 in one stream. FFmpeg recreates the VA context (`session open` x2) and both paths decode 2 frames, but the reference MD5 differs; it is the same in-context resolution-change family as the AV1 stall above, not a pixel defect. |

## Power: saturated decode, software versus this driver (2026-10-24)

Method: battery gauge `voltage_now x |current_now|` at 1 Hz, screen off
(backlight 0, idle 1.4 W), arms interleaved A/B per round so background drift
cancels, first 4 s of each window discarded as the ramp transient, 10 s pre-
and post-baseline. The workload re-decodes the clip back to back so the window
is always full; a paced `-re` run leaves the device mostly idle and buries the
difference in gauge noise (measured: a 30 s paced run gave 218 +/- 62 mW for
the VA arm and 124 +/- 32 mW for software, which does not resolve).

| Workload | VA-API | Software | Difference |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1280x720, unpaced, n=4 | +1861 +/- 64 mW | +5149 +/- 429 mW | **-3289 mW** |
| 1920x1080, unpaced, n=4 | +2089 +/- 158 mW | +6177 +/- 761 mW | **-4087 mW** |

CPU cost of the same two decodes (`-benchmark`, whole clip, no pacing):
720p VA `utime=0.302s stime=0.183s`, software `utime=2.202s stime=0.146s`;
1080p VA `utime=0.487s stime=0.192s`, software `utime=4.020s stime=0.180s`.

Interpretation: at saturation the decoder offload is worth about 3.3 W at
720p and 4.1 W at 1080p on this tablet. That is the cost of doing the work on
the CPU, not a claim about a browser session: a browser that plays at 30 fps
spends most of the time idle and the saving is smaller and noisier, which is
why the paced numbers above cannot resolve it. The gauge measures the whole
device; there is no per-block telemetry on this SoC.
